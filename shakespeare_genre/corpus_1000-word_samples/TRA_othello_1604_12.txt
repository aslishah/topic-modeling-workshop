town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers wak d with strife exeunt all but iago and cassio iago what are you hurt lieutenant cassio ay past all surgery iago marry heaven forbid cassio reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation iago as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he is yours cassio i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one s own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil iago what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you cassio i know not iago is t possible cassio i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered cassio it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unbless d and the ingredient is a devil iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you cassio i have well approved it sir i drunk iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i ll tell you what you shall do our general s wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before cassio you advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and what s he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she s fram d as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetter d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body s lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all enter roderigo how now roderigo roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been to night exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice iago how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou know st we work by wit
