life shall prove it true that mowbray hath receiv d eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness soldiers the which he hath detain d for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was survey d by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all
