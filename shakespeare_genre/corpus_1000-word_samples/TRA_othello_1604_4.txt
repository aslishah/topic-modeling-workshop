daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little bless d with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have us d their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnish d tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter brabantio a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush d at herself

against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o er the blood or with some dram conjur d to this effect he wrought upon her duke to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him first

portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste despatch she d come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d
