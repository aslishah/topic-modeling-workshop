my propension and cut of all fears attending on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one man s valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should ne er retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit priam paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all paris sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wip d off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransack d queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms there s not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow d or death unfam d where helen is the subject then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the world s large spaces cannot parallel hector paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have gloz d but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristode thought unfit to

disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to sparta s king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return d thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hector s opinion is this in way of truth yet ne er the less my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean dependence upon our joint and several dignities troilus why there you touch d the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of troyan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promis d glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world s revenue hector i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dull and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was
