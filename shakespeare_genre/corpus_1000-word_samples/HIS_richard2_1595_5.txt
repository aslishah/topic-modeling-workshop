contrive or complot any ill gainst us our state our subjects or our land bolingbroke i swear mowbray and i to keep all this bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wand red in the air banish d this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banish d from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burden of a guilty soul mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banish d as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the world s my way exit king richard uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banish d years pluck d four away to bolingbroke six frozen winters spent return with welcome home from banishment bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son s exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son king richard why uncle thou hast many years to live gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou can st help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath king richard thy son is banish d upon good advice whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave why at our justice seem st thou then to lower gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urg d me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroy d alas i look d when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong king richard cousin farewell and uncle bid him so six years we banish him and he shall go flourish exit king richard and train aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let

prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten gaunt call it a travel that thou tak st for pleasure bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an enforced pilgrimage gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exil d thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
