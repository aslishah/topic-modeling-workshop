of people at a door throng her inventions which shall go before at last she thus begins thou worthy lord of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford of ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see some present speed to come and visit me so i commend me from our house in grief my woes are tedious though my words are brief here folds she up the tenour of her woe her certain sorrow writ uncertainly by this short schedule collatine may know her grief but not her grief s true quality she dares not thereof make discovery lest he should hold it her own gross abuse ere she with blood had stain d her stain d excuse besides the life and feeling of her passion she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion of her disgrace the better so to clear her from that suspicion which the world my might bear her to shun this blot she would not blot the letter with words till action might become them better to see sad sights moves more than hear them told for then the eye interprets to the ear the heavy motion that it doth behold when every part a part of woe doth bear tis but a part of sorrow that we hear deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words her letter now is seal d and on it writ at ardea to my lord with more than haste the post attends and she delivers it charging the sour faced groom to hie as fast as lagging fowls before the northern blast speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems extremely still urgeth such extremes the homely villain court sies to her low and blushing on her with a steadfast eye receives the scroll without or yea or no and forth with bashful innocence doth hie but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie imagine every eye beholds their blame for lucrece thought he blush d to see her shame when silly groom god wot it was defect of spirit life and bold audacity such harmless creatures have a true respect to talk in deeds while others saucily promise more speed but do it leisurely even so this pattern of the worn out age pawn d honest looks but laid no words to gage his kindled duty kindled her mistrust that two red fires in both their faces blazed she thought he blushed as knowing tarquin s lust and blushing with him wistly on him gazed her earnest eye did make him more amazed the more saw the blood his cheeks replenish the more she thought he spied in her some blemish but long she thinks till he return again and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone the weary time she cannot entertain for now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan that she her plaints a little while doth stay pausing for means to mourn some newer way at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece of skilful painting made for priam s troy before the which is drawn the power of greece for helen s rape the city to destroy threatening cloud kissing ilion with annoy which the conceited painter drew so proud as heaven it seem d to kiss the turrets bow d a thousand lamentable objects there in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life many a dry drop seem d a weeping tear shed for the slaughter d husband by the wife the red blood reek d to show the painter s strife the dying eyes gleam d forth their ashy lights like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights there might you see the labouring pioner begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust and from the towers of troy there would appear the very eyes of men through loop holes thrust gazing upon the greeks with little lust such sweet observance in this work was had that one might see those far off eyes look sad in great commanders grace and majesty you might behold triumphing in their faces in youth quick bearing and dexterity and here and there the painter interlaces pale cowards marching on with trembling paces which heartless peasants did so well resemble that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble in ajax and ulysses o what art of physiognomy might one behold the face of either cipher d either s heart their face their manners most expressly told in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour roll d but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent show d deep regard and smiling government there pleading might you see grave nestor stand as twere encouraging the greeks to fight making such sober action with his hand that it beguiled attention charm d the sight in speech it seem d his beard all silver white wagg d up and down and from his lips did fly thin winding breath which curl d up to the sky about him were a press of gaping faces which seem d to swallow up his sound advice all jointly listening but with several graces as if some mermaid did their ears entice some high some low the painter was so nice the scalps of many almost hid behind to jump up higher seem d to mock the mind here one man s hand lean d on another s head his nose being shadow d by his neighbour s ear here one being throng d bears back all boll n and red another smother d seems to pelt and swear and in their rage such signs of rage they bear as but for loss of nestor s golden words it seem d they would debate with angry swords for much
