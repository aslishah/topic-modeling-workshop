juliet above juliet hist romeo hist o for a falconer s voice to lure this tassel gentle back again bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud else would i tear the cave where echo lies and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo s name romeo it is my soul that calls upon my name how silver sweet sound lovers tongues by night like softest music to attending ears juliet romeo romeo my dear juliet at what o clock to morrow shall i send to thee romeo at the hour of nine juliet i will not fail tis twenty years till then i have forgot why i did call thee back

a silk thread plucks it back again so loving jealous of his liberty romeo i would i were thy bird juliet sweet so would i yet i should kill thee with much cherishing good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow exit romeo sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest hence will i to my ghostly father s cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell exit scene iii friar lawrence s cell enter friar lawrence with a basket friar the grey ey d morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day s path and titan s fiery wheels non ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night s dank dew to dry i must up fill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers the earth that s nature s mother is her tomb what is her burying gave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but strain d from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by action dignified within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant enter romeo romeo good morrow father friar benedicite what early tongue so sweet saluteth me young son it argues a distemper d head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed care keeps his watch in every old man s eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuff d brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous d with some distemperature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed
