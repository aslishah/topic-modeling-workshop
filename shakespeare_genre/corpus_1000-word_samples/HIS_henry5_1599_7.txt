the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either s purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so

the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me grey never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy o er myself prevented from a damned enterprise my fault but not
