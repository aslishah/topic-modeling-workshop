thy heart s workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell how like eve s apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show xciv they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmoved cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit heaven s graces and husband nature s riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the summer s flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds xcv how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beauty s veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife ill us d doth lose his edge xcvi some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are lov d of more and less thou mak st faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteem d so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deem d how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report xcvii how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old december s bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was summer s time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widow d wombs after their lords decease yet this abundant issue seem d to me but hope of orphans and unfather d fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winter s near xcviii from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dress d in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laugh d and leap d with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer s story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lily s white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seem d it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play xcix the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love s breath the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my love s veins thou hast too grossly dy d the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stol n thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stol n of both and to his robbery had annex d thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stol n from thee c where art thou muse that thou forget st so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spend st thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument rise resty muse my love s sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make time s spoils despised every where give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou prevent st his scythe and crooked knife ci o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy d both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say truth needs no colour with his colour fix d beauty no pencil beauty s truth to lay but best is best if never intermix d because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so for t lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be prais d of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now cii my love is strengthen d though more
