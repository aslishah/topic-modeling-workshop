is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him leon how many gentlemen have you lost in this action mess but few of any sort and none of name leon a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio mess much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how leon he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it mess i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge
