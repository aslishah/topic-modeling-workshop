remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall cominius twas from the canon coriolanus shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra leave to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monster wants not spirit to say he ll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learn d be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great st taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown d in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other cominius well on to the market place coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas us d sometime in greece menenius well well no more

courtesy let deeds express what s like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble
