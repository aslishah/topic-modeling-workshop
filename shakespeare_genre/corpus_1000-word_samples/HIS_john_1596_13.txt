drop hath fallen even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief like true inseparable faithful loves sticking together in calamity constance to england if you will king philip bind up your hairs constance yes that i will and wherefore will i do it i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud o that these hands could so redeem my son as they have given these hairs their liberty but now i envy at their liberty and will again commit them to their bonds because my poor child is a prisoner and father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born but now will canker sorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meagre as an ague s fit and so he ll die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more pandulph you hold too heinous a respect of grief constance he talks to me that never had a son king philip you are as fond of grief as of your child constance grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do i will not keep this form upon my head tearing off her head dress when there is such disorder in my wit o lord my boy my arthur my fair son my life my joy my food my ail the world my widow comfort and my sorrows cure exit king philip i fear some outrage and i ll follow her exit louis there s nothing in this world can make me joy life is as tedious as a twice told tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man and bitter shame hath spoil d the sweet world s taste that it yields nought but shame and bitterness pandulph before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day louis all days of glory joy and happiness pandulph if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threatening eye tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you griev d that arthur is his prisoner louis as heartily as he is glad he hath him pandulph your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the
