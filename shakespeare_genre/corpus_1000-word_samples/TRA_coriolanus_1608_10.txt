his power go sleep sicinius he cannot temp rately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won brutus in that there s comfort sicinius doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make as little question as he is proud to do t brutus i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the market place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths sicinius tis right brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles sicinius i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution brutus tis most like he will sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction brutus so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to s power he would have made them mules silenc d their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in their war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them sicinius this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want if it be put upon t and that s as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever enter a messenger brutus what s the matter messenger you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he pass d the nobles bended as to jove s statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like brutus let s to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event sicinius have with you exeunt scene ii rome the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions first officer come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships second officer three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it first officer that s a brave fellow but he s vengeance proud and loves not the common people second officer faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who ne er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see t first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it first officer no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming a sennet enter with lictors before them cominius the consul menenius coriolanus senators sicinius and brutus the senators take their places the tribunes take theirs also by themselves menenius having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform d by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself first senator speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our state s defective for requital than we to stretch it out masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here sicinius we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly brutus which the rather we shall be bless d to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto priz d them at menenius that s off that s off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak brutus most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent
