audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war s a destroyer of men second servant tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds first servant ay and it makes men hate one another third servant reason because they then less need one
