we are to travel forth so far beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold celia i ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants rosalind were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me all points like a man a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden woman s fear there will we ll have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances celia what shall i call thee when thou art a man rosalind i ll have no worse a name than jove s own page and therefore look you call me ganymede but what will you be call d celia something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia but aliena rosalind but cousin what if we assay d to steal the clownish fool out of your father s court would he not be a comfort to our travel celia he ll go along o er the wide world with me leave me alone to woo him let s away and get our jewels and our wealth together devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment exeunt act ii scene i the forest of arden enter duke senior amiens and other lords in the dress of foresters duke senior now my co mates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter s wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything i would not change it amiens happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style duke senior come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gor d first lord indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish d you to day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequester d stag that from the hunter s aim had ta en a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heav d forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears cours d one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears duke senior but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle first lord o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou mak st a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what s worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign d and native dwelling place duke senior and did you leave him in this contemplation second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer duke senior show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then he s full of matter first lord i ll bring you to him straight exeunt scene ii a room in the palace enter duke frederick lords and attendants duke frederick can it be possible that no man saw them it cannot be some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this first lord i cannot hear of any that did see her the ladies her attendants of her chamber saw her a bed and in the morning early they found the bed untreasur d of their mistress second lord my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh is also missing hesperia the princess gentlewoman confesses that she secretly o erheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company duke frederick send to his brother fetch that gallant hither if he be absent
