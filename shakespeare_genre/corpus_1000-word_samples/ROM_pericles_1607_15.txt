o dionyza such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon ne er look d upon dionyza i think you ll turn a child agan cleon were i chief lord of all this spacious world i ld give it to undo the deed lady much less in blood than virtue yet a princess to equal any single crown o the earth i the justice of compare o villain leonine whom thou hast poison d too if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness becoming well thy fact what canst thou say when noble pericles shall demand his child dionyza that she is dead nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve she died at night i say so who can cross it unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out she died by foul play cleon o go to well well of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst dionyza be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit cleon to such proceeding whoever but his approbation added though not his prime consent he did not flow from honourable sources dionyza be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone she did distain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marina s face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day it pierced me through and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness perform d to your sole daughter cleon heavens forgive it dionyza and as for pericles what should he say we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn her monument is almost finish d and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her and care in us at whose expense tis done cleon thou art like the harpy which to betray dost with thine angel s face seize with thine eagle s talons dionyza you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know you ll do as i advise exeunt scene iv enter gower before the monument of marina at tarsus gower thus time we waste and longest leagues make short sail seas in cockles have an wish but for t making to take your imagination from bourn to bourn region to region by you being pardon d we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you the stages of our story pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his life s deight old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate is left to govern bear you it in mind old helicanus goes along behind well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus think his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on to fetch his daughter home who first is gone like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes i ll reconcile dumb show enter pericles at one door with all his train cleon and dionyza at the other cleon shows pericles the tomb whereat pericles makes lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs then exeunt cleon and dionyza see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrow d passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devour d with sighs shot through and biggest tears o ershower d leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza reads the inscription on marina s monument the fairest sweet st and best lies here who wither d in her spring of year she was of tyrus the king s daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she call d and at her birth thetis being proud swallow d some part o the earth therefore the earth fearing to be o erflow d hath thetis birth child on the heavens bestow d wherefore she does and swears she ll never stint make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughter s dead and bear his courses to be ordered by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughter s woe and heavy well a day in her unholy service patience then and think you now are all in mytilene exit scene v mytilene a street before the brothel
