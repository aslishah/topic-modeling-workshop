that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he ll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i ll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye s too quick my heart o erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i ll make my heaven in a lady s lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mother s womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither d shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlick d bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be belov d o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o erbear such as are of better person than myself i ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my mis shap d trunk that bear this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murther while i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i ll slay more gazers than the basilisk i ll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with protheus for advantages and set the murtherous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i ll pluck it down exit scene iii france the king s palace flourish enter lewis the french king and lady bona attended
