what i have to do is yours being part in all i have devoted yours were my worth greater my duty would show greater meantime as it is it is bound to your lordship to whom i wish long life still lengthened with all happiness your lordship s in all duty william shakespeare lucius tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed superbus after he had caused his own father in law servius tullius to be cruelly murdered and contrary to the roman laws and customs not requiring or staying for the people s suffrages had possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of rome to besiege ardea during which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of sextus tarquinius the king s son in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife lucretia in that pleasant humour they all posted to rome and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece beauty yet smothering his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight hastily dispatched messengers one to rome for her father another to the camp for collatine they came the one accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause of her sorrow she first taking an oath of them for her revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and withal suddenly stabbed herself which done with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the people were so moved that with one consent and a general acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings to consuls from the besieged ardea all in post borne by the trustless wings of false desire lust breathed tarquin leaves the roman host and to collatium bears the lightless fire which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire and girdle with embracing flames the waist of collatine s fair love lucrece the chaste haply that name of chaste unhappily set this bateless edge on his keen appetite when collatine unwisely did not let to praise the clear unmatched red and white which triumph d in that sky of his delight where mortal stars as bright as heaven s beauties with pure aspects did him peculiar duties for he the night before in tarquin s tent unlock d the treasure of his happy state what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent in the possession of his beauteous mate reckoning his fortune at such high proud rate that kings might be espoused to more fame but king nor peer to such a peerless dame o happiness enjoy d but of a few and if possess d as soon decay d and done as is the morning s silver melting dew against the golden splendour of the sun an expired date cancell d ere well begun honour and beauty in the owner s arms are weakly fortress d from a world of harms beauty itself doth of itself persuade the eyes of men without an orator what needeth then apologies be made to set forth that which is so singular or why is collatine the publisher of that rich jewel he should keep unknown from thievish ears because it is his own perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty suggested this proud issue of a king for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be perchance that envy of so rich a thing braving compare disdainfully did sting his high pitch d thoughts that meaner men should vaunt that golden hap which their superiors want but some untimely thought did instigate his all too timeless speed if none of those his honour his affairs his friends his state neglected all with swift intent he goes to quench the coal which in his liver glows o rash false heat wrapp d in repentant cold thy hasty spring still blasts and ne er grows old when at collatium this false lord arrived well was he welcomed by the roman dame within whose face beauty and virtue strived which of them both should underprop her fame when virtue bragg d beauty would blush for shame when beauty boasted blushes in despite virtue would stain that o er with silver white but beauty in that white intituled from venus doves doth challenge that fair field then virtue claims from beauty beauty s red which virtue gave the golden age to gild their silver cheeks and call d it then their shield teaching them thus to use it in the fight when shame assail d the red should fence the white this heraldry
