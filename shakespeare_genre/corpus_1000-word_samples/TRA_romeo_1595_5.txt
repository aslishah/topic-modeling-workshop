true mercutio o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men s noses as they lie asleep her waggon spokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spider s web the collars of the moonshine s watery beams her whip of cricket s bone the lash of film her waggoner a small grey coated gnat not half so big as a round little worm prick d from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazel nut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love o er courtiers knees that dream on court sies straight o er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees o er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithe pig s tail tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elf locks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she romeo peace peace mercutio peace thou talk st
