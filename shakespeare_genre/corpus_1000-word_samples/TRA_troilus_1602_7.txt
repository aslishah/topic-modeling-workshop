in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector s grandsire suck d he is old now but if there be not in our grecian mould one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither d brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandame and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood i ll prove this truth with my three drops of blood aeneas now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ulysses amen agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you first achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe exeunt all but ulysses and nestor ulysses nestor nestor what says ulysses ulysses i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape nestor what is t ulysses this tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp d or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all nestor well and how ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles nestor true the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libya though apollo knows tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hector s purpose pointing on him ulysses and wake him to the answer think you nestor why tis most meet who may you else oppose that can from hector bring those honours off if not achilles though t be a sportful combat yet in this trial much opinion dwells for here the troyans taste our dear st repute with their fin st palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly pois d in this vile action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mas of things to come at large it is suppos d he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as twere from forth us all a man distill d out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence a conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertain d limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs ulysses give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants show our foulest wares and think perchance they ll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better by showing the worst first do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg d with two strange followers nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should wear with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foil d why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lott ry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we ll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our project s life this shape of sense assumes ajax employ d plucks down achilles plumes nestor now ulysses i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste thereof forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone exeunt act ii scene the grecian camp enter ajax and thersites ajax thersites thersites agamemnon how if he had boils full an over generally ajax thersites thersites and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core ajax dog thersites then there would come some matter from him i see none now ajax thou bitch wolf s son canst thou not hear feel then strikes him thersites the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beef witted lord ajax speak then thou whinid st leaven speak i will beat thee into handsomeness thersites i shall sooner rail thee
