where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence tell him his fears are shallow without instance and for his dreams i wonder he s so simple to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase go bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower where he shall see the boar will use us kindly messenger i ll go my lord and tell him what you say exit enter catesby catesby many good morrows to my noble lord hastings good
