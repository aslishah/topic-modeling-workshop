in kind love i do conjure thee who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly character d and engrav d to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honour i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus lucetta alas the way is wearisome and long julia a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath love s wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus lucetta better forbear till proteus make return julia o know st thou not his looks are my soul s food pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time didst thou but know the inly touch of love thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words lucetta i do not seek to quench your love s hot fire but qualify the fire s extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason julia the more thou damm st it up the more it burns the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know st being stopp d impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with th enamell d stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean then let me go and hinder not my course i ll be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there i ll rest as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium lucetta but in what habit will you go along julia not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page lucetta why then your ladyship must cut your hair

make your breeches julia that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you wear your farthingale why even what fashion thou best likes lucetta lucetta you must needs have them with a codpiece madam julia out out lucetta that will be ill favour d lucetta a round hose madam now s not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on julia lucetta as thou lov st me let me have what thou think st meet and is most mannerly but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey i fear me it will make me scandaliz d lucetta if you think so then stay at home and go not julia nay that i will not lucetta then never dream on infamy but go if proteus like your journey when you come no matter who s displeas d when you are gone i fear me he will scarce be pleas d withal julia that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus lucetta all these are servants to deceitful men julia base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth lucetta pray heav n he prove so when you come to him julia now as thou lov st me do him not that wrong to bear a hard
