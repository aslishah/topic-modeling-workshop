direful god of war whose sinewy neck in battle ne er did bow who conquers where he comes m every jar yet hath he been my captive and my slave and begg d for that which thou unask d shalt have over my altars hath he hung his lance his batter d shield his uncontrolled crest and for my sake hath learn d to sport and dance to toy to wanton dally smile and jest scorning his churlish drum and ensign red making my arms his field his tent my bed thus he that overrul d i oversway d leading him prisoner in a red rose chain strong temper d steel his stronger strength obey d yet was he servile to my coy disdain o be not proud nor brag not of thy might for mastering her that foil d the god of fight touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine though mine be not so fair yet are they red the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes art thou asham d to kiss then wink again and i will wink so shall the day seem night love keeps his revels where there are but twain be bold to play our sport is not in sight these blue vein d violets whereon we lean never can blab nor know not what we mean the tender spring upon thy tempting lip shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted make use of time let not advantage slip beauty within itself should not be wasted fair flowers that are not gather d in their prime rot and consume themselves in little time were i hard favour d foul or wrinkled old ill nurtur d crooked churlish harsh in voice o erworn despised rheumatic and cold thick sighted barren lean and lacking juice then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee but having no defects why dost abhor me thou canst not see one winkle in my brow mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear or like a fairy trip upon the green or like a nymph with long dishevell d hair dance on the sands and yet no footing seen love is a spirit all compact of fire not gross to sink but light and will aspire witness this primrose bank whereon i lie these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky from morn till night even where i list to sport me is love so light sweet boy and may it be that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee is thine own heart to shine own face affected can thy right hand seize love upon thy left then woo thyself be of thyself rejected steal thine own freedom and complain on theft narcissus so himself himself forsook and died to kiss his shadow in the brook torches are made to light jewels to wear dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear things growing to themselves are growth s abuse seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty thou wast begot to get it is thy duty upon the earth s increase why shouldst thou feed unless the earth with thy increase be fed by law of nature thou art bound to breed that thine may live when thou thyself art dead and so in spite of death thou dost survive in that thy likeness still is left alive by this the love sick queen began to sweat for where they lay the shadow had forsook them and titan tired in the mid day heat with burning eye did hotly overlook them wishing adonis had his team to guide so he were like him and by venus side and now adonis with a lazy spright and with a heavy dark disliking eye his louring brows o erwhelming his fair sight like misty vapours when they blot the sky souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love the sun doth burn my face i must remove ay me quoth venus young and so unkind what bare excuses mak st thou to be gone i ll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind shall cool the heat of this descending sun i ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs if they burn too i ll quench them with my tears the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm and lo i lie between that sun and thee the heat i have from thence doth little harm thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me and were i not immortal life were done between this heavenly and earthly sun art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth art thou a woman s son and canst not feel what tis to love how want of love tormenteth o had thy mother borne so hard a mind she had not brought forth thee but died unkind what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this or what great danger dwells upon my suit what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute give me one kiss i ll give it thee again and one for interest if thou wilt have twain fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone well painted idol image dull and dead statue contenting but the eye alone thing like a man but of no woman
