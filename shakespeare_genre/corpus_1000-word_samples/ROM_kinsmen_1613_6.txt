past but have you a full promise of her when that shall be seene i tender my consent enter daughter wooer i have sir here shee comes iailor your friend and i have chanced to name you here upon the old busines but no more of that now so soone as the court hurry is over we will have an end of it i th meane time looke tenderly to the two prisoners i can tell you they are princes daughter these strewings are for their chamber tis pitty they are in prison and twer pitty they should be out i doe thinke they have patience to make any adversity asham d the prison it selfe is proud of em and they have all the world in their chamber iailor they are fam d to be a paire of absolute men daughter by my troth i think fame but stammers em they stand a greise above the reach of report iailor i heard them reported in the battaile to be the only doers daughter nay most likely for they are noble suffrers i mervaile how they would have lookd had they beene victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedome out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at iailor doe they so daughter it seemes to me they have no more sence of their captivity then i of ruling athens they eate well looke merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their owne restraint and disasters yet sometime a devided sigh martyrd as twer i th deliverance will breake from one of them when the other presently gives it so sweete a rebuke that i could wish my selfe a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted wooer i never saw em iailor the duke himselfe came privately in the night enter palamon and arcite above and so did they what the reason of it is i know not looke yonder they are that s arcite lookes out daughter no sir no that s palamon arcite is the lower of the twaine you may perceive a part of him iailor goe too leave your pointing they would not make us their object out of their sight daughter it is a holliday to looke on them lord the diffrence of men exeunt scaena the prison enter palamon and arcite in prison palamon how doe you noble cosen arcite how doe you sir palamon why strong inough to laugh at misery and beare the chance of warre yet we are prisoners i feare for ever cosen arcite i beleeve it and to that destiny have patiently laide up my houre to come palamon o cosen arcite where is thebs now where is our noble country where are our friends and kindreds never more must we behold those comforts never see the hardy youthes strive for the games of honour hung with the painted favours of their ladies like tall ships under saile then start among st em and as an eastwind leave en all behinde us like lazy clowdes whilst palamon and arcite even in the wagging of a wanton leg out stript the peoples praises won the garlands ere they have time to wish em ours o never shall we two exercise like twyns of honour our armes againe and feele our fyry horses like proud seas under us our good swords now better the red eyd god of war nev r wore ravishd our sides like age must run to rust and decke the temples of those gods that hate us these hands shall never draw em out like lightning to blast whole armies more arcite no palamon those hopes are prisoners with us here we are and here the graces of our youthes must wither like a too timely spring here age must finde us and which is heaviest palamon unmarried the sweete embraces of a loving wife loden with kisses armd with thousand cupids shall never claspe our neckes no issue know us no figures of our selves shall we ev r see to glad our age and like young eagles teach em boldly to gaze against bright armes and say remember what your fathers were and conquer the faire eyd maides shall weepe our banishments and in their songs curse ever blinded fortune till shee for shame see what a wrong she has done to youth and nature this is all our world we shall know nothing here but one another heare nothing but the clocke that tels our woes the vine shall grow but we shall never see it sommer shall come and with her all delights but dead cold winter must inhabite here still palamon tis too true arcite to our theban houndes that shooke the aged forrest with their ecchoes no more now must we halloa no more shake our pointed iavelyns whilst the angry swine flyes like a parthian quiver from our rages strucke with our well steeld darts all valiant uses the foode and nourishment of noble mindes in us two here shall perish we shall die which is the curse of honour lastly children of greife and ignorance arcite yet cosen even from the bottom of these miseries from all that fortune can inflict upon us i see two comforts rysing two meere blessings if the gods please to hold here a brave patience and the enjoying of our greefes together whilst palamon is with me let me perish if i thinke this our prison palamon certeinly tis a maine goodnes cosen that our fortunes were twyn d together tis most true two soules put in two noble bodies let em suffer the gaule of hazard so they grow together will never sincke they must not say they could a willing man dies sleeping and all s done arcite shall we make worthy uses of this place that all men hate so much palamon how gentle
