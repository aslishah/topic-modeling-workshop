these three swashers i am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man for bardolph he is white liver d and red fac d by the means whereof a faces it out but fights not for pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks words and keeps whole weapons for nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be thought a coward but his few bad words are match d with as few good deeds for a never broke any man s head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk they will steal anything and call it purchase bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three half pence nym and bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in calais they stole a fire shovel i knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals they would have me as familiar with men s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if i should take from another s pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs i must leave them and seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore i must cast it up exit enter gower and fluellen gower captain fluellen you must come presently to the mines the duke of
