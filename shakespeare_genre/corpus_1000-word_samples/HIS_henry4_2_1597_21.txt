twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that s no marvel he drinks no wine there s never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so over cool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are

and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack enter bardolph how now bardolph bardolph the army is discharged all and gone falstaff let them go i ll through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire i have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away exeunt scene iv westminster the jerusalem chamber enter the king the princes thomas of clarence and humphrey of gloucester warwick and others king now lords if god doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth at our doors we will our youth lead on to higher fields and draw no swords but what are sanctified our navy is address d our power collected our substitutes in absence well invested and every thing lies level to our wish only we want a little personal strength and pause us till these rebels now afoot come underneath the yoke of government warwick both which we doubt not but your majesty shall soon enjoy king humphrey my son of gloucester where is the prince your brother gloucester i think he s gone to hunt my lord at windsor king and how accompanied gloucester i do not know my lord king is not his brother thomas of clarence with him gloucester no my good lord he is in presence here clarence what would my lord and father king nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed he s flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congealed in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observed chide him for
