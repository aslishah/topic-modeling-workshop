it at your peril what say you to this sir duke what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon provost a bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old duke how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof duke it is now apparent provost most manifest and not denied by himself duke hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what s past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal duke he wants advice provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all duke more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy provost pray sir in what duke in the delaying death provost alack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudio s to cross this in the smallest duke by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour duke o death s a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life provost pardon me good father it is against my oath duke were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy provost to him and to his substitutes duke you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing provost but what likelihood is in that duke not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you provost i know them both duke the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the duke s death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardine s head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn exeunt scene iii another
