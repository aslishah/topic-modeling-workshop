tis he slink by and note him celia and rosalind retire enter orlando and jaques jaques i thank you for your company but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone orlando and so had i but yet for fashion s sake i thank you too for your society jaques god buy you let s meet as little as we can orlando i do desire we may be better strangers jaques i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks orlando i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favouredly jaques rosalind is your love s name orlando yes just jaques i do not like her name orlando there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened jaques what stature is she of orlando just as high as my heart jaques you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings orlando not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions jaques you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalanta s heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery orlando i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults jaques the worst fault you have is to be in love orlando tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you jaques by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you orlando he is drowned in the brook look but in and you shall see him jaques there i shall see mine own figure orlando which i take to be either a fool or a cipher jaques i ll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love orlando i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy exit jaques celia and rosalind come forward rosalind i will speak to him like a saucy lacquey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester orlando very well what would you rosalind i pray you what is t o clock orlando you should ask me what time o day there s no clock in the forest rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper rosalind by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i ll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal orlando i pr ythee who doth he trot withal rosalind marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se nnight time s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year orlando who ambles time withal rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal orlando who doth he gallop withal rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there orlando who stays it still withal rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves orlando where dwell you pretty youth rosalind with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat orlando are you native of this place rosalind as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled orlando your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling rosalind i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal orlando can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women rosalind there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it orlando i pr ythee recount some of them rosalind no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him orlando i am he that is so love shaked i pray you tell me your remedy rosalind there is none of my uncle s marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner orlando what were his marks rosalind a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard
