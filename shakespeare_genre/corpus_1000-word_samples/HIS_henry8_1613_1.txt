several lords and ladies in the dumb shows women attending upon the queen scribes officers guards and other attendants scene london westminster kimbolton the prologue i come no more to make you laugh things now that bear a weighty and a serious brow sad high and working full of state and woe such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow we now present those that can pity here may if they think it well let fall a tear the subject will deserve it such as give their money out of hope they may believe may here find truth too those that come to see only a show or two and so agree the play may pass if they be still and willing i ll undertake may see away their shilling richly in two short hours only they that come to hear a merry bawdy play a noise of targets or to see a fellow in a long motley coat guarded with yellow will be deceiv d for gentle hearers know to rank our chosen truth with such a show as fool and fight is beside forfeiting our own brains and the opinion that we bring to make that only true we now intend will leave us never an understanding friend therefore for goodness sake and as you are known the first and happiest hearers of the town be sad as we would make ye think ye see the very persons of our noble story as they were living think you see them great and follow d with the general throng and sweat of thousand friends then in a moment see how soon this mightiness meets misery and if you can be merry then i ll say a man may weep upon his wedding day act i scene london an ante chamber in the palace enter the duke of norfolk at one door at the other the duke of buckingham and the lord abergavenny buckingham good morrow and well met how have ye done since last we saw in france norfolk i thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there buckingham an untimely ague stay d me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren norfolk twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four thron d ones could have weigh d such a compounded one buckingham all the whole time i was my chamber s prisoner norfolk then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next day s master till the last made former wonders its to day the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and to morrow they made britain india every man that stood show d like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all gilt the madams too not us d to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and the ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns for so they phrase em by their heralds challeng d the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thought s compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believ d buckingham o you go far norfolk as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of ev rything would by a good discourser lose some life which action s self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebell d order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function buckingham who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess norfolk one certes that promises no element in such a business buckingham i pray you who my lord norfolk all this was ord red by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york buckingham the devil speed him no man s pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o th beneficial sun and keep it from the earth norfolk surely sir there s in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not propp d by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor call d upon for high
