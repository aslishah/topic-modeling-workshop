oberon i wonder if titania be awak d then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity enter puck here comes my messenger how now mad spirit what night rule now about this haunted grove puck my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus nuptial day the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enter d in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an ass s nowl i fix egrave d on his head anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimic comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russet pated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the gun s report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here o er and o er one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania wak d and straightway lov d an ass oberon this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latch d the athenian s eyes with the love juice as i did bid thee do puck i took him sleeping that is finish d too and the athenian woman by his side that when he wak d of force she must be ey d enter demetrius and hermia oberon stand close this is the same athenian puck this is the woman but not this the man demetrius o why rebuke you him that loves you so lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe hermia now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being o er shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stol n away from sleeping hermia i ll believe as soon this whole earth may be bor d and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brother s noontide with the antipodes it cannot be but thou hast murder d him so should a murderer look so dead so grim demetrius so should the murder d look and so should i pierc d through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere hermia what s this to my lysander where is he ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me demetrius i had rather give his carcass to my hounds hermia out dog out cur thou driv st me past the bounds of maiden s patience hast thou slain him then henceforth be never number d among men oh once tell true tell true even for my sake durst thou have look d upon him being awake and hast thou kill d him sleeping o brave touch could not a worm an adder do so much an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung demetrius you spend your passion on a mispris d mood i am not guilty of lysander s blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell hermia i pray thee tell me then that he is well demetrius an if i could what should i get therefore hermia a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no exit demetrius there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain so sorrow s heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay lies down oberon what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite and laid the love juice on some true love s sight of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love
