in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is be total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you pol fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion i play anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause a roused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends pol this is too long ham it shall to the barber s with your beard pr ythee say on he s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba i play but who o who had seen the mobled queen ham the mobled queen pol that s good mobled queen is good i play run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o erteemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steep d gainst fortune s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods pol look whether he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more ham tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live pol my lord i will use them according to their desert ham odd s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should

monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive
