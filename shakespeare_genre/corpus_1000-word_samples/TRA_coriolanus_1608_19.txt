accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you cominius well well no more coriolanus what is the matter that being pass d for consul with full voice i am so dishonour d that the very hour you take it off again sicinius answer to us coriolanus say then tis true i ought so sicinius we charge you that you have contriv d to take from rome all season d office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people coriolanus how traitor menenius nay temperately your promise coriolanus the fires i the lowest hell fold in the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutch d as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods sicinius mark you this people citizens to the rock to the rock with him sicinius peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death brutus but since he hath serv d well for rome coriolanus what do you prate of service brutus i talk of that that know it coriolanus you menenius is this the promise that you made your mother cominius know i pray you coriolanus i ll know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have t with saying good morrow sicinius for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i the people s name i say it

me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies marks upon me i do love my country s good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife s estimate her

it shall be so citizens it shall be so it shall be so coriolanus you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won
