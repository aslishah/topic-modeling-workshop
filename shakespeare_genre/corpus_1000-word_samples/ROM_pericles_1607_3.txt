the great antiochus gainst whom i am too little to contend since he s so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known he ll stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces he o erspread the land and with the ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquish d ere they do resist and subjects punish d that ne er thought offence which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish enter helicanus with other lords first lord joy and all comfort in your sacred breast second lord and keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable helicanus peace peace and give experience tongue they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing the which is flatter d but a spark to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you makes war upon your life prince pardon me or strike me if you please i cannot be much lower than my knees pericles all leave us else but let your cares o erlook what shipping and what lading is in our haven and then return to us exeunt lords helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks helicanus an angry brow dread lord pericles if there be such a dart in princes frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face helicanus how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment pericles thou know st i have power to take thy life from thee helicanus kneeling i have ground the axe myself do you but strike the blow pericles rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do helicanus to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself pericles thou speak st like a physician helicanus that minister st a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch and there as thou know st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest hark in thine ear as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seem d not to strike but smooth but thou know st this tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seem d my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt he ll fill this land with arms and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call offence must feel war s blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reprovest me for it helicanus alas sir pericles drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them helicanus well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than i ll be pericles i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence helcanus we ll mingle our bloods together in the earth from whence we had our being and our birth pericles tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i ll hear from thee and by whose letters i ll dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects good on thee i lay whose wisdom s strength can bear it i ll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs we ll live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall ne er convince thou show dst a subject s shine i a true prince exeunt scene iii tyre an ante chamber in the palace enter thaliard thaliard so this is tyre and this the court here must i kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to be hanged at home tis dangerous
