my troth the instrument is cold and would not harm me hubert i can heat it boy arthur no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief being create for comfort to be us d in undeserv d extremes see else yourself there is no malice in this burning coal the breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out and strew d repentant ashes on his head hubert but with my breath i can revive it boy arthur an if you do you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes and like a dog that is compell d to fight snatch at his master that doth tarre him on all things that you should use to do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends creatures of note for mercy lacking uses hubert well see to live i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes yet i am sworn and i did purpose boy with this same very iron to burn them out arthur o now you look like hubert all this while you were disguised hubert peace no more adieu your uncle must not know but you are dead i ll fill these dogged spies with false reports and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure that hubert for the wealth of all the world will not offend thee arthur o heaven i thank you hubert hubert silence no more go closely in with me much danger do i undergo for thee exeunt scene the same a room of state in the palace enter king john crowned pembroke salisbury and other lords the king takes his state king john here once again we sit once again crown d and look d upon i hope with cheerful eyes pembroke this once again but that your highness pleas d was once superfluous you were crown d before and that high royalty was ne er pluck d off the faiths of men ne er stained with revolt fresh expectation troubled not the land with any long d for change or better state salisbury therefore to be possess d with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taper light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess pembroke but that your royal pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesome being urged at a time unseasonable salisbury in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights consideration makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashion d robe pembroke when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousness and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patch d salisbury to this effect before you were new crown d we breath d our counsel but it pleas d your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleas d since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will king john some reasons of this double coronation i have possess d you with and think them strong and more more strong when lesser is my fear i shall indue you with meantime but ask what you would have reform d that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests pembroke then i as one that am the tongue of these to sound the purposes of all their hearts both for myself and them but chief of all your safety for the which myself and them bend their best studies heartily request the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint doth move the murmuring lips of discontent to break into this dangerous argument if what in rest you have in right you hold why then your fears which as they say attend the steps of wrong should move you to mew up your tender kinsman and to choke his days with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth the rich advantage of good exercise that the time s enemies may not have this to grace occasions let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal on you depending counts it your weal he have his liberty king john let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction enter hubert hubert what news with you pembroke this is the man should do the bloody deed he show d his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye that close aspect of his doth show the mood of a much troubled breast and i do fearfully believe tis done what we so fear d he had a charge to do salisbury the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe it needs must break pembroke and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet child s death king john we cannot hold mortality s strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead
