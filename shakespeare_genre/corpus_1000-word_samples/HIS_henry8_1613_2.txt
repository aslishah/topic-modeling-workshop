board of council out must fetch him in he papers abergavenny i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sicken d their estates that never they shall abound as formerly

him both full of disdain wolsey the duke of buckingham s surveyor ha where s his examination secretary here so please you wolsey is he in person ready secretary ay please your grace wolsey well we
