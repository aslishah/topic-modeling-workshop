safely i think twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentleman s opinion by this worn out posthumus she holds her virtue still and i my mind iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy posthumus being so far provok d as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend iachimo as fair and as good a kind of hand in hand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady posthumus i prais d her as i rated her so do i my stone iachimo what do you esteem it at posthumus more than the world enjoys iachimo either your unparagon d mistress is dead or she s outpriz d by a trifle posthumus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods iachimo which the gods have given you posthumus which by their graces i will keep iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplish d courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last posthumus your italy contains none so accomplish d a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring philario let us leave here gentlemen posthumus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend posthumus no no iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o ervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world posthumus you are a great deal abus d in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what you re worthy of by your attempt iachimo what s that posthumus a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbour s on the approbation of what i have spoke posthumus what lady would you choose to assail iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv d posthumus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger tis part of it iachimo you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear posthumus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what s spoken i swear posthumus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between s my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here s my ring philario i will have it no lay iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoy d the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment posthumus i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail d i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduc d you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded posthumus agreed exeunt posthumus and iachimo frenchman will this hold
