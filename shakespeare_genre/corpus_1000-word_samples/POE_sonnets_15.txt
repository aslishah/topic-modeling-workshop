the lesson true drugs poison him that so fell sick of you cxix what potions have i drunk of siren tears distill d from limbecks foul as hell within applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears still losing when i saw myself to win what wretched errors hath my heart committed whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better and ruin d love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first more strong far greater so i return rebuk d to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent cxx that you were once unkind befriends me now and for that sorrow which i then did feel needs must i under my transgression bow unless my nerves were brass or hammer d steel for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours you ve pass d a hell of time and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffer d in your crime o that our night of woe might have remember d my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits and soon to you as you to me then tender d the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits but that your trespass now

forgetfulness in me cxxiii no time thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel nothing strange they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told thy registers and thee i both
