of your frame wh r we are mended or wh r better they or whether revolution be the same o sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise lx like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crown d crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beauty s brow feeds on the rarities of nature s truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand lxi is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight is it thy spirit that thou send st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenure of thy jealousy o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near lxii sin of self love possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for myself mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and chopp d with tanned antiquity mine own self love quite contrary i read self so self loving were iniquity tis thee myself that for myself i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days lxiii against my love shall be as i am now with time s injurious hand crush d and o erworn when hours have drain d his blood and fill d his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travell d on to age s steepy night and all those beauties whereof now he s king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age s cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love s beauty though my lover s life his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green lxiv when i have seen by time s fell hand defac d the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down raz d and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose lxv since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality o ersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summer s honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of battering days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall time s best jewel from time s chest lie hid or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright lxvi tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimm d in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplac d and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgrac d and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority and folly doctor like controlling skill and simple truth miscall d simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tir d with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone lxvii ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace itself with his society why should false painting imitate his cheek and steel dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggar d of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad lxviii thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere
