will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks the nurse to still her child will tell my story and fright her crying babe with tarquin s name the orator to deck his oratory will couple my reproach to tarquin s shame feast finding minstrels tuning my defame will tie the hearers to attend each line how tarquin wronged me i collatine let my good name that senseless reputation for collatine s dear love be kept unspotted if that be made a theme for disputation the branches of another root are rotted and undeserved reproach to him allotted that is as clear from this attaint of mine as i ere this was pure to collatine o unseen shame invisible disgrace o unfelt sore crest wounding private scar reproach is stamp d in collatinus face and tarquin s eye may read the mot afar how he in peace is wounded not in war alas how many bear such shameful blows which not themselves but he that gives them knows if collatine thine honour lay in me from me by strong assault it is bereft my honey lost and i a drone like bee have no perfection of my summer left but robb d and ransack d by injurious theft in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept and suck d the honey which thy chaste bee kept yet am i guilty of thy honour s wrack yet for thy honour did i entertain him coming from thee i could not put him back for it had been dishonour to disdain him besides of weariness he did complain him and talk d of virtue o unlook d for evil when virtue is profaned in such a devil why should the worm intrude the maiden bud or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests or toads infect fair founts with venom mud or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts or kings be breakers of their own behests but no perfection is so absolute that some impurity doth not pollute the aged man that coffers up his gold is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold but like still pining tantalus he sits and useless barns the harvest of his wits having no other pleasure of his gain but torment that it cannot cure his pain so then he hath it when he cannot use it and leaves it to be master d by his young who in their pride do presently abuse it their father was too weak and they too strong to hold their cursed blessed fortune long the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours even in the moment that we call them ours unruly blasts wait on the tender spring unwholesome weeds
