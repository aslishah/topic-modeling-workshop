occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents lucius i know his lordship is but merry with me he cannot want fifty five hundred talents servilius but in the mean time he wants less my lord if his occasion were not virtuous i should not urge it half so faithfully lucius dost thou speak seriously servilius servilius upon my soul tis true sir lucius what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such a good time when i might ha shown myself honourable how unluckily it happened that i should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour servilius now before the gods i am not able to do the more beast i say i was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had done it now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power to be kin and tell him this from me i count it one of my greatest afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman good servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him servilius yes sir i shall lucius i ll look you out a good turn servilius exit servilius true as you said timon is shrunk indeed and he that s once denied will hardly speed exit first stranger do you observe this hostilius second stranger ay too well first stranger why this is the world s soul and just of the same piece is every flatterer s spirit who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lord s father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timon s money has paid his men their wages he ne er drinks but timon s silver treads upon his lip and yet o see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars third stranger religion groans at it first stranger for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honourable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have return d to him so much i love his heart but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above conscience exeunt scene iii the same a room in sempronius house enter sempronius and a servant of timon s sempronius must he needs trouble me in t hum bove all others he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus and now ventidius is wealthy too whom he redeem d from prison all these owe their estates unto him servant my lord they have all been touch d and found base metal for they have all denied him sempronius how have they denied him has ventidius and lucullus denied him and does he send to me three hum it shows but little love or judgment in him must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians thrice give him over must i take the cure upon me has much disgrac d me in t i m angry at him that might have known my place i see no sense for t but his occasions might have woo d me first for in my conscience i was the first man that e er received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me now that i ll requite it last no so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest and i mongst lords be thought a fool i had rather than the worth of thrice the sum had sent to me first but for my mind s sake i d such a courage to do him good but now return and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honour shall not know my coin exit servant excellent your lordship s a goodly villain the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by t and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear how fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire of such a nature is his politic love this was my lord s best hope now all are fled save only the gods now his friends are dead doors that were ne er acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employ d now to guard sure their master and this is all a liberal course allows who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house exit scene iv a hall in timon s house enter two servants of varro and the servant of lucius meeting titus hortensius and other servants to timon s creditors waiting his coming out first varro s servant well met good morrow titus and hortensius titus the like to you kind varro hortensius lucius what do we meet together lucius servant ay and i think one business does command us all for mine is money titus so is theirs and ours enter philotus lucius servant and sir philotus too philotus good day at once lucius servant wlcome good brother what do you think the hour philotus labouring for nine lucius servant so much philotus is not my lord seen yet lucius servant not yet philotus i wonder on t he was wont to shine at seven lucius
