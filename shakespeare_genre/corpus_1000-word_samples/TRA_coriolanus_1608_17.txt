break out and sack great rome with romans brutus if it were so sicinius what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come menenius consider this he has been bred i the wars since a could draw a sword and is ill school d in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave i ll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril first senator noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning sicinius noble menenius be you then as the people s officer masters lay down your weapons brutus go not home sicinius meet on the market place we ll attend you there where if you bring not marcius we ll proceed in our first way menenius i ll bring him to you to the senators let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow first senator pray you let s to him exeunt scene ii rome a room in coriolanus s house enter coriolanus and patricians coriolanus let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them first patrician you do the nobler coriolanus i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war enter volumnia i talk of you to volumnia why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am volumnia o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out coriolanus let go volumnia you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show d them how ye were dispos d ere they lack d power to cross you coriolanus let them hang volumnia ay and burn too enter menenius with the senators menenius come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it first senator there s no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish volumnia pray be counsell d i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage menenius well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear coriolanus what must i do menenius return to the tribunes coriolanus well what then what then menenius repent what you have spoke coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then do t to them volumnia you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever d friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th other lose that they combine not there coriolanus tush tush menenius a good demand volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request coriolanus why force you this volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom s truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake requir d i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin menenius noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past volumnia i pr ythee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch d it here be with them thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person menenius this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being
