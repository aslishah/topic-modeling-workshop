the text is old the orator too green therefore in sadness now i will away my face is full of shame my heart of teen mine ears that to your wanton talk attended do burn themselves for having so offended with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace of those fair arms which bound him to her breast and homeward through the dark laund runs apace leaves love upon her back deeply distress d look how a bright star shooteth from the sky so glides he in the night from venus eye which after him she darts as one on shore gazing upon a late embarked friend till the wild waves will have him seen no more whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend so did the merciless and pitchy night fold in the object that did feed her sight whereat amaz d as one that unaware hath dropp d a precious jewel in the flood or stonish d as night wanderers often are their light blown out in some mistrustful wood even so confounded in the dark she lay having lost the fair discovery of her way and now she beats her heart whereat it groans that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled make verbal repetition of her moans passion on passion deeply is redoubled ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe and twenty echoes twenty times cry so she marking them begins a wailing note and sings extemporally a woeful ditty how love makes young men thrall and old men dote how love is wise in folly foolish witty her heavy anthem stili concludes in woe and still the choir of echoes answer so her song was tedious and outwore the night for lovers hours are long though seeming short if pleas d themselves others they think delight in such like circumstance with such like sport their copious stories oftentimes begun end without audience and are never done for who hath she to spend the night withal but idle sounds resembling parasites like shrill tongu d tapsters answering every call soothing the humour of fantastic wits she says tis so they answer all tis so and would say after her if she said no lo here the gentle lark weary of rest from his moist cabinet mounts up on high and wakes the morning from whose silver breast the sun ariseth in his majesty who doth the world so gloriously behold that cedar tops and hills seem burnish d gold venus salutes him with this fair good morrow o thou clear god and patron of all light from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow the beauteous influence that makes him bright there lives a son that suck d an earthly mother may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove musing the morning is so much o erworn and yet she hears no tidings of her love she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn anon she hears them chant it lustily and all in haste she coasteth to the cry and as she runs the bushes in the way some catch her by the neck some kiss her face some twine about her thigh to make her stay she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake by this she hears the hounds are at a bay whereat she starts like one that spies an adder wreath d up in fatal folds just in his way the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder even so the timorous yelping of the hounds appals her senses and her spirit confounds for now she knows it is no gentle chase but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud because the cry remaineth in one place wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud finding their enemy to be so curst they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear througll which it enters to surprise her heart who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear with cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part like soldiers when their captain once doth yield they basely fly and dare not stay the field thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy till cheering up her senses sore dismay d she tells them tis a causeless fantasy and childish error that they are afraid bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more and with that word she spied the hunted boar whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red like milk and blood being mingled both together a second fear through all her sinews spread which madly hurries her she knows not whither this way she runs and now she will no further but back retires to rate the boar for murther a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways she treads the path that she untreads again her more than haste is mated with delays like the proceedings of a drunken brain full of respects yet nought at all respecting in hand with all things nought at all effecting here kennel d in a brake she finds a hound l and asks the weary caitiff for his master and there another licking of his wound gainst venom d sores the only sovereign plaster and here she meets another sadly scowling to whom she speaks and he replies with howling when he hath ceas d his ill resounding noise another flap mouth d mourner black and grim against the welkin volleys out his voice another and another answer him clapping their proud tails to the ground below shaking their scratch d ears bleeding as they go look how the world s poor people are amaz d at apparitions signs and prodigies whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz d infusing them with dreadful prophecies so she at these sad sighs draws up her breath and
