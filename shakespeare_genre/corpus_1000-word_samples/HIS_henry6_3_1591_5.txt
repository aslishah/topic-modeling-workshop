sepulchre with this we charg d again but out alas we budg d again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with overmatching waves a short alarum within ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are number d that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end enter queen margaret clifford northumberland and soldiers come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment show d unto my father now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whate er you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcon s piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives gainst the officers york o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought o errun my former time and if thou canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckle with thee blows twice two for one queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor s life wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is war s prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour they lay hands on york who struggles clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net york is taken prisoner york so triumph thieves upon their conquer d booty so true men yield with robbers so o ermatch d northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be england s king was t you that revell d in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and where s that valiant crook back prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i stain d this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier s point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance what hath thy fiery heart so parch d thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland s death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus thou wouldst be feed i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henry s chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crown d so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry s glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o t is a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead clifford that is my office for my father s sake queen margaret nay stay let s hear the orisons he makes york she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder s tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou cam st of whom deriv d were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death t is beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small
