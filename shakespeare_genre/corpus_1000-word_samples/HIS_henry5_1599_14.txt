shall i know of thee montjoy my master s mind king henry unfold it montjoy thus says my king say thou to harry of england though we seem d dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness tell him we could have rebuk d him at harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial england shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re answer his pettishness would bow under for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounc d so far my king and master so much my office king henry what is thy name i know thy quality montjoy montjoy king henry thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessen d and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbour stand in our way there s for thy labour montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hind red we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master montjoy i shall deliver so thanks to your highness exit gloucester i hope they will not come upon us now king henry we are in god s hands brother
