cleave a heart in twain claudio but is there any isabella yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you ll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death claudio perpetual durance isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world s vastidity you had to a determin d scope claudio but in what nature isabella in such a one as you consenting to t would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked claudio let me know the point isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour dar st thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies claudio why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms isabella there spake my brother there my father s grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outward sainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell claudio the

claudio ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thick ribbed ice to be imprison d in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death isabella alas alas claudio sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brother s life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue isabella o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest
