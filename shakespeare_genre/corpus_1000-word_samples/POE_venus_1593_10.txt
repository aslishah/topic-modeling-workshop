their dark beds once more leap her eyes and being open d threw unwilling light upon the wide wound that the boar had trench d in his soft flank whose wonted lily white with purple tears that his wound wept was drench d no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed but stole his blood and seem d with him to bleed this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth over one shoulder doth she hang her head dumbly she passions franticly she doteth she thinks he could not die he is not dead her voice is stopp d her joints forget to bow her eyes are mad that they have wept till now upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three and then she reprehends her mangling eye that makes more gashes where no breach should be his face seems twain each several limb is doubled for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled my tongue cannot express my grief for one and yet quoth she behold two adons dead my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone mine eyes are turn d to fire my heart to lead heavy heart s lead melt at mine eyes red fire so shall i die by drops of hot desire alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost what face remains alive that s worth the viewing whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast of things long since or anything ensuing the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim but true sweet beauty liv d and died with him bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you having no fair to lose you need not fear the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you but when adonis liv d sun and sharp air lurk d like two thieves to rob him of his fair and therefore would he put his bonnet on under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep the wind would blow it off and being gone play with his locks then would adonis weep and straight in pity of his tender years they both would strive who first should dry his tears to see his face the lion walk d along behind some hedge because he would not fear him to recreate himself when he hath sung the tiger would be tame and gently hear him if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey and never fright the silly lamb that day when he beheld his shadow in the brook the fishes spread on it their golden gills when he was by the birds such pleasure took that some would sing some other in their bills would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries he fed them with his sight they him with berries but this foul grim and urchin spouted boar whose downward eye still looketh for a grave ne er saw the beauteous livery that he wore witness the entertainment that he gave if he did see his face why then i know he thought to kiss him and hath killed him so tis true tis true thus was adonis slain he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear who did not whet his teeth at him again but by a kiss thought to persuade him there and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine sheath d unaware the tusk in his soft groin had i been tooth d like him i must confess with kissing him i should have kill d him first but he is dead and never did he bless my youth with his the more am i accurst with this she falleth in the place she stood and stains her face with his congealed blood sho looks upon his lips and they are pale she takes him by the hand and that is cold she whispers in his ears a heavy tale as if they heard the woeful words she told she lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies two glasses where herself herself beheld a thousand times and now no more reflect their virtue lost wherein they late excell d and every beauty robb d of his effect wonder of time quoth she this is my spite that you being dead the day should yet be light since thou art dead lo here i prophesy sorrow on love
