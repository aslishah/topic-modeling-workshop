sighing it again exclaims on death hard favour d tyrant ugly meagre lean hateful divorce of love thus chides she death grim grinning ghost earth s worm what dost thou mean to stifle beauty and to steal his breath who when he liv d his breath and beauty set gloss on the rose smell to the violet if he be dead o no it cannot be seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see but hatefully at random dost thou hit thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant s heart hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke and hearing him thy power had lost his power the destinies will curse thee for this stroke they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck st a flower love s golden arrow at him shoull have fled and not death s ebon dart to strike him dead dost thou drink tears that thou provok st such weeping what may a heavy groan advantage thee why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping those eyes that taught all other eyes to see now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour since her best work is ruin d with thy rigour here overcome as one full of despair she vail d her eyelids who like sluices stopp d the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair in the sweet channel of her bosom dropp d but through the flood gates breaks the silver rain and with his strong course opens them again o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye both crystals where they view d each other s sorrow sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry but like a stormy day now wind now rain sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again variable passions throng her constant woe as striving who should best become her grief all entertain d each passion labours so that every present sorrow seemeth chief but none is best then join they all together like many clouds consulting for foul weather by this far off she hears some huntsman holloa a nurse s song no er pleas d her babe so well the dire imagination she did follow this sound of hope doth labour to expel for now reviving joy bids her rejoice and flatters her it is adonis voice whereat her tears began to turn their tide being prison d in her eye like pearls in glass yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground who is but drunken when she seemeth drown d o hard believing love how strange it seems not to believe and yet too credulous thy weal and woe are both of them extremes despair and hope make thee ridiculous the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought adonis lives and death is not to blame it was not she that call d him all to naught now she adds honours to his hateful name she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings imperious supreme of all mortal things no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear whenas i met the boar that bloody beast which knows no pity but is still severe then gentle shadow truth i must confess i rail d on thee fearing my love s decease tis not my fault the boar provok d my tongue be wreak d on him invisible commander tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong i did but act he s author of my slander grief hath two tongues and never woman yet could rule them both without ten women s wit thus hoping that adonis is alive her rash suspect sile doth extenuate and that his beauty may the better thrive with death she humbly doth insinuate tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories his victories his triumphs and his glories o jove quoth she how much a fool was i to be of such a weak and silly mind to wail his death who lives and must not die till mutual overthrow of mortal kind for he being dead with him is beauty slain and beauty dead black chaos comes again fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear as one with treasure laden hemm d with thieves trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves even at this word she hears a merry horn whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn as falcon to the lure away she flies the grass stoops not she treads on it so light and in her haste unfortunately spies the foul boar s conquest on her fair delight which seen her eyes as murder d with the view like stars asham d of day themselves withdrew or as the snail whose tender horns being hit shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain and there all smother d up in shade doth sit long after fearing to creep forth again so at his bloody view her eyes are fled into the deep dark cabills of her head where they resign their office and their light to the disposing of her troubled brain who bids them still consort with ugly night and never wound the heart with looks again who like a king perplexed in his throne by their suggestion gives a deadly groan whereat each tributary subject quakes as when the wind imprison d in the ground struggling for passage earth s foundation shakes which with cold terror doth men s minds confound this mutiny each part doth so surprise l that from
