warwick to the parliament king i muse my lord of gloster is not come tis not his wont to be the hindmost man whate er occasion keeps him from us now queen can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alter d countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admir d him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars

bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make

deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloster is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit cardinal did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done york and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted buckingham tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey king my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloster is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless
