way would hector have it aeneas he cares not he ll obey conditions achilles tis done like hector but securely done a little proudly and great deal misprising the knight oppos d aeneas if not achilles sir what is your name achilles if not achilles nothing aeneas therefore achilles but whate er know this in the extremity of great and little valour and pride excel themselves in hector the one almost as infinite as all the other blank as nothing weigh him well and that which looks like pride is courtesy this ajax is half made of hector s blood in love whereof half hector stays at home half heart half hand half hector comes to seek this blended knight half trojan and half greek achilles a maiden battle then o i perceive you re enter diomedes agamemnon here is sir diomed go gentle knight stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin ajax and hector enter the lists ulysses they are oppos d already agamemnon what trojan is that same that looks so heavy ulysses the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provok d nor being provok d soon calm d his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impure thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with

blows are well dispos d there ajax diomedes you must no more trumpets cease aeneas princes enough so please you ajax i am not warm yet let us fight again diomedes as hector pleases hector why then will i no more thou art great lord my father s sister s son a cousin german to great priam s seed the obligation of our blood forbids a gory emulation twixt us twain were thy commixtion greek and trojan so that thou could st say this hand is grecian all and this is trojan the sinews of this leg all greek and this all troy my mother s blood runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister bounds in my father s by jove multipotent thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member wherein my sword had not impressure made of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay that any drop thou borrow dst from thy mother my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword be drained let me embrace thee ajax by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms hector would have them fall upon him thus cousin all honour to thee ajax i thank thee hector thou art too gentle and too free a man i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence a great addition earned in thy death hector not neoptolemus so mirable on whose bright crest fame with her loud st oyes cries this is he could promise to himself a thought of added honour torn from hector aeneas there is expectance here from both the sides what further you will do hector we

give me thy hand my cousin i will go eat with thee and see your knights agamemnon and the rest of the greeks come forward ajax great agamemnon comes to meet us here hector the worthiest of them tell me name by name but for achilles my own searching eyes shall find him by his large and portly size agamemnon worthy of arms as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy but that s no
