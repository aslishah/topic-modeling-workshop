still is t meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have sav d ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmast what of him our slaught red friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allow d the skilful pilot s charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but a ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock
