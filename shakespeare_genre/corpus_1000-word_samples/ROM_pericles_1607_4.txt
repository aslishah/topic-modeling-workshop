king bid a man be a villain he s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one hush here come the lords of tyre enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre helicanus you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre further to question me of your king s departure his seal d commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently he s gone to travel thaliard aside how the king gone helicanus if further yet you will be satisfied why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart i ii give some light unto you being at antioch thaliard aside what from antioch helicanus royal antiochus on what cause i know not took some displeasure at him at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had err d or sinn d to show his sorrow he ld correct himself so puts himself unto the shipman s

depart this we desire as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre exeunt scene iv tarsus a room in the governor s house enter cleon the governor of tarsus with dionyza and others cleon my dionyza shall we rest us here and by relating tales of others griefs see if twill teach us to forqet our own dionyza that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it for who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher o my distressed lord even such our griefs are here they re but felt and seen with mischief s eyes but like to groves being topp d they higher rise cleon o dionyza who wanteth food and will not say he wants it or can conceal his hunger till he famish our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes into the air our eyes do weep till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder that if heaven slumber while their creatures want they may awake their helps to comfort them i ll then discourse our woes felt several years and wanting breath to speak help me with tears dionyza i ll do my best sir cleon this tarsus o er which i have the government a city on whom plenty held full hand for riches strew d herself even in the streets whose towers bore heads so high they kiss d the clouds and strangers ne er beheld but wonder d at whose men and dames so jetted and adorn d like one another s glass to trim them by their tables were stored full to glad the sight and not so much to feed on as delight all poverty was scorn d and pride so great the name of help grew odious to repeat dionyza o tis too true cleon but see what heaven can do by this our change these mouths who but of late earth sea and air were all too little to content and please although they gave their creatures in abundance as houses are defiled for want of use they are now starved for want of exercise those palates who not yet two summers younger must have inventions to delight the taste would now be glad of bread and beg for it those mothers who to nousle up their babes thought nought too curious are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved so sharp are hunger s teeth that man and wife draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life here stands a lord and there a lady weeping here many sink yet those which see them fall have scarce strength left to give them burial is not this true dionyza our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it cleon o let those cities that of plenty s cup and her prosperities so largely taste with their superflous riots hear these tears the misery of tarsus may be theirs enter a lord lord where s the lord governor cleon here speak out thy sorrows which thou bring st in haste for comfort is too far for us to expect lord we have descried upon our neighbouring shore a portly sail of ships make hitherward cleon i thought as much one sorrow never comes but brings an heir that may succeed as his inheritor and so in ours some neighbouring nation taking advantage of our misery math stuff d these hollow vessels with their power to beat us down the which are down already and make a conquest of unhappy me whereas no glory s got to overcome lord that s the least fear for by the semblance of their white flags display d they bring us peace and come to us as favourers not as foes cleon thou speak st like him s untutor d to repeat who makes the fairest show means most deceit but bring they what they will and what they can what need we fear the ground s the lowest and we are half way there go tell their general we attend him here to
