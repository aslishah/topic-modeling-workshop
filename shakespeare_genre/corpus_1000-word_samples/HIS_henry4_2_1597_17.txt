man made after supper of a cheese paring when a was naked he was for all the world like a fork d radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife a was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the
