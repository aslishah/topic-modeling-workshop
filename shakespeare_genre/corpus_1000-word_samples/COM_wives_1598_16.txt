master brook ford how so sir did she change her determination falstaff no master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embraced kissed protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife s love ford what while you were there falstaff while i was there ford and did he search for you and could not find you falstaff you shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford s approach and in her invention and ford s wife s distraction they conveyed me into a buck basket ford a buck basket
