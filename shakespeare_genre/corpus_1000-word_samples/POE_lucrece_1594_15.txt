vain what he breathes out his breath drinks up again as through an arch the violent roaring tide outruns the eye that doth behold his haste yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride back to the strait that forced him on so fast in rage sent out recall d in rage being past even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw to push grief on and back the same grief draw which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth another power no flood by raining slaketh my woe too sensible thy passion maketh more feeling painful let it then suffice to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes and for my sake when i might charm thee so for she that was thy lucrece now attend me be suddenly revenged on my foe thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me comes all too late yet let the traitor die for sparing justice feeds iniquity but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she speaking to those that came with collatine shall plight your honourable faiths to me with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine for tis a meritorious fair design to chase injustice with revengeful arms knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms at this request with noble disposition each present lord began to promise aid as bound in knighthood to her imposition longing to hear the hateful foe bewray d but she that yet her sad task hath not said the protestation stops o speak quoth she how may this forced stain be wiped from me what is the quality of mine offence being constrain d with dreadful circumstance may my pure mind with the foul act dispense my low declined honour to advance may any terms acquit me from this chance the poison d fountain clears itself again and why not i from this compelled stain with this they all at once began to say her body s stain her mind untainted clears while with a joyless smile she turns away the face that map which deep impression bears of hard misfortune carved in it with tears no no quoth she no dame hereafter living by my excuse shall claim excuses giving here with a sigh as if her heart would break she throws forth tarquin s name he he she says but more than he her poor tongue could not speak till after many accents and delays untimely breathings sick and short assays she utters this he he fair lords tis he that guides this hand to give this wound to me even here she sheathed in her harmless breast a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed that blow did bail it from the deep unrest of that polluted prison where it breathed her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly life s lasting date from cancell d destiny stone still astonish d with this deadly deed stood collatine and all his lordly crew till lucrece father that beholds her bleed himself on her self slaughter d body threw and from the purple fountain brutus drew the murderous knife and as it left the place her blood in poor revenge held it in chase and bubbling from her breast it doth divide in two slow rivers that the crimson blood circles her body in on every side who like a late sack d island vastly stood bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood some of her blood still pure and red remain d and some look d black and that false tarquin stain d about the mourning and congealed face of that black blood a watery rigol goes which seems to weep upon the tainted place and ever since as pitying lucrece woes corrupted blood some watery token shows and blood untainted still doth red abide blushing at that which is so putrified daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries that life was mine which thou hast here deprived if in the child the father s image lies where shall i live now lucrece is unlived thou wast not to this end from me derived if children pre decease progenitors we are their offspring and they none of ours poor broken glass i often did behold in thy sweet semblance my old age new born but now that fair fresh mirror dim and old shows me a bare boned death by time outworn o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn and shiver d all the beauty of my glass that i no more can see what once i was o time cease thou thy course and last no longer if they surcease to be that should survive shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger and leave the faltering feeble souls alive the old bees die the young possess their hive then live sweet lucrece live again and see thy father die and not thy father thee by this starts collatine as from a dream and bids lucretius give his sorrow place and then in key cold lucrece bleeding stream he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face and counterfeits to die with her a space till manly shame bids him possess his breath and live to be revenged on her death the deep vexation of his inward soul hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue who mad that sorrow should his use control or keep him from heart easing words so long begins to talk but through his lips do throng weak words so thick come in his poor heart s aid that no man could distinguish what he said yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain but through his teeth as if the name he tore this windy tempest till it blow up rain held back his sorrow
