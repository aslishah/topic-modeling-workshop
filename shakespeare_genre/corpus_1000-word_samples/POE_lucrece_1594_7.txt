chastest tears that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed the spots whereof could weeping purify her tears should drop on them perpetually but she hath lost a dearer thing than life and he hath won what he would lose again this forced league doth force a further strife this momentary joy breeds months of pain this hot desire converts to cold disdain pure chastity is rifled of her store and lust the thief far poorer than before look as the full fed hound or gorged hawk unapt for tender smell or speedy flight make slow pursuit or altogether balk the prey wherein by nature they delight so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night his taste delicious in digestion souring devours his will that lived by foul devouring o deeper sin than bottomless conceit can comprehend in still imagination drunken desire must vomit his receipt ere he can see his own abomination while lust is in his pride no exclamation can curb his heat or rein his rash desire till like a jade self will himself doth tire and then with lank and lean discolour d cheek with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace feebly desire all recreant poor and meek like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace for there it revels and when that decays the guilty rebel for remission prays so fares it with this faultful lord of rome who this accomplishment so hotly chased for now against himself he sounds this doom that through the length of times he stands disgraced besides his soul s fair temple is defaced to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares to ask the spotted princess how she fares she says her subjects with foul insurrection have batter d down her consecrated wall and by their mortal fault brought in subjection her immortality and made her thrall to living death and pain perpetual which in her prescience she controlled still but her foresight could not forestall their will even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth a captive victor that hath lost in gain bearing away the wound that nothing healeth the scar that will despite of cure remain leaving his spoil perplex d in greater pain she hears the load of lust he left behind and he the burden of a guilty mind he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence she like a wearied lamb lies panting there he scowls and hates himself for his offence she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear he faintly flies sweating with guilty fear she stays exclaiming on the direful night he runs and chides his vanish d loathed delight he thence departs a heavy convertite she there remains a hopeless castaway he in his speed looks for the morning light she prays she never may behold the day for day quoth she night s scapes doth open lay and my true eyes have never practised how to cloak offences with a cunning brow they think not but that every eye can see the same disgrace which they themselves behold and therefore would they still in darkness be to have their unseen sin remain untold for they their guilt with weeping will unfold and grave like water that doth eat in steel upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel here she exclaims against repose and rest and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind she wakes her heart by beating on her breast and bids it leap from thence where it may find some purer chest to close so pure a mind frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite against the unseen secrecy of night o comfort killing night image of hell dim register and notary of shame black stage for tragedies and murders fell vast sin concealing chaos nurse of blame blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame grim cave of death whispering conspirator with close tongued treason and the ravisher o hateful vaporous and foggy night since thou art guilty of my cureless crime muster thy mists to meet the eastern light make war against proportion d course of time or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb his wonted height yet ere he go to bed knit poisonous clouds about his golden head with rotten damps ravish the morning air let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick the life of purity the supreme fair ere he arrive his weary noon tide prick and let thy misty vapours march so thick that in their smoky ranks his smother d light may set at noon and make perpetual night were tarquin night as he is but night s child the silver shining queen he would distain her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled through night s black bosom should not peep again so should i have co partners in my pain and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage where now i have no one to blush with me to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine to mask their brows and hide their infamy but i alone alone must sit and pine seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans poor wasting monuments of lasting moans o night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke let not the jealous day behold that face which underneath thy black all hiding cloak immodesty lies martyr d with disgrace keep still possession of thy gloomy place that all the faults which in thy reign are made may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade make me not object to the tell tale day the light will show character d in my brow the story of sweet chastity s decay the impious breach of holy wedlock vow yea the illiterate that know not how to cipher what is writ in learned books
