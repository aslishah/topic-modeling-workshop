in lucrece face was seen argued by beauty s red and virtue s white of either s colour was the other queen proving from world s minority their right yet their ambition makes them still to fight the sovereignty of either being so great that oft they interchange each other s seat their silent war of lilies and of roses which tarquin view d in her fair face s field in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses where lest between them both it should be kill d the coward captive vanquished doth yield to those two armies that would let him go rather than triumph in so false a foe now thinks he that her husband s shallow tongue the niggard prodigal that praised her so in that high task hath done her beauty wrong which far exceeds his barren skill to show therefore that praise which collatine doth owe enchanted tarquin answers with surmise in silent wonder of still gazing eyes this earthly saint adored by this devil little suspecteth the false worshipper for unstain d thoughts do seldom dream on evil birds never limed no secret bushes fear so guiltless she securely gives good cheer and reverend welcome to her princely guest whose inward ill no outward harm express d for that he colour d with his high estate hiding base sin in plaits of majesty that nothing in him seem d inordinate save sometime too much wonder of his eye which having all all could not satisfy but poorly rich so wanteth in his store that cloy d with much he pineth still for more but she that never coped with stranger eyes could pick no meaning from their parling looks nor read the subtle shining secrecies writ in the glassy margents of such books she touch d no unknown baits nor fear d no hooks nor could she moralize his wanton sight more than his eyes were open d to the light he stories to her ears her husband s fame won in the fields of fruitful italy and decks with praises collatine s high name made glorious by his manly chivalry with bruised arms and wreaths of victory her joy with heaved up hand she doth express and wordless so greets heaven for his success far from the purpose of his coming hither he makes excuses for his being there no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather doth yet in his fair welkin once appear till sable night mother of dread and fear upon the world dim darkness doth display and in her vaulty prison stows the day for then is tarquin brought unto his bed intending weariness with heavy spright for after supper long he questioned with modest lucrece and wore out the night now leaden slumber with life s strength doth fight and every one to rest themselves betake save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving the sundry dangers of his will s obtaining yet ever to obtain his will resolving though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining and when great treasure is the meed proposed though death be adjunct there s no death supposed those that much covet are with gain so fond for what they have not that which they possess they scatter and unloose it from their bond and so by hoping more they have but less or gaining more the profit of excess is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain the aim of all is but to nurse the life with honour wealth and ease in waning age and in this aim there is such thwarting strife that one for all or all for one we gage as life for honour in fell battle s rage honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost the death of all and all together lost so that in venturing ill we leave to be the things we are for that which we expect and this ambitious foul infirmity in having much torments us with defect of that we have so then we do neglect the thing we have and all for want of wit make something nothing by augmenting it such hazard now must doting tarquin make pawning his honour to obtain his lust and for himself himself he must forsake then where is truth if there be no self trust when shall he think to find a stranger just when he himself himself confounds betrays to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days now stole upon the time the dead of night when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes no comfortable star did lend his light no noise but owls and wolves death boding cries now serves the season that they may surprise the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still while lust and murder wake to stain and kill and now this lustful lord leap d from his bed throwing his mantle rudely o er his arm is madly toss d between desire and dread th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm but honest fear bewitch d with lust s foul charm doth too too oft betake him to retire beaten away by brain sick rude desire his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth which must be lode star to his lustful eye and to the flame thus speaks advisedly as from this cold flint i enforced this fire so lucrece must i force to my desire here pale with fear he doth premeditate the dangers of his loathsome enterprise and in his inward mind he doth debate what following sorrow may on this arise then looking scornfully he doth despise his naked armour of still slaughter d lust and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust fair torch burn
