in this case but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch puffs forth another wind that fires the torch and being lighted by the light he spies lucretia s glove wherein her needle sticks he takes it from the rushes where it lies and griping it the needle his finger pricks as who should say this glove to wanton tricks is not inured return again in haste thou see st our mistress ornaments are chaste but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him he in the worst sense construes their denial the doors the wind the glove that did delay him he takes for accidental things of trial or as those bars which stop the hourly dial who with a lingering stay his course doth let till every minute pays the hour his debt so so quoth he these lets attend the time like little frosts that sometime

blessed thing he sought so from himself impiety hath wrought that for his prey to pray he doth begin as if the heavens should countenance his sin but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer having solicited th eternal power that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair and they would stand auspicious to the hour even there he starts quoth he i must de flower the powers to whom i pray abhor

eyeballs in his head by their high treason is his heart misled which gives the watch word to his hand full soon to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon look as the fair and fiery pointed sun rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun to wink being blinded with a greater light whether it is that she reflects so bright that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed o had they in that darksome prison died then had they seen the period of their ill then collatine again by lucrece side in his clear
