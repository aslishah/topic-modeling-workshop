chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come portia i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection nerissa first there is the neapolitan prince portia ay that s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother play d false with a smith nerissa then is there the county palatine portia he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a death s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two nerissa how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon portia god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan s a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england portia you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper man s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere nerissa what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour portia that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another nerissa how like you the young german the duke of saxony s nephew portia very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him nerissa if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father s will if you should refuse to accept him portia therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge nerissa you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father s imposition depending on the caskets portia if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father s will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure nerissa do you not remember lady in your father s time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat portia yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he called nerissa true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady portia i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise enter a servant how now what news servant the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here to night portia if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door exeunt scene venice a public place enter bassanio and shylock shylock three thousand ducats well bassanio ay sir for three months shylock for three months well bassanio for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound shylock
