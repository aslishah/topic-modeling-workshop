know thee not thy name coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devour d the rest and suffer d me by the voice of slaves to be whoop d out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me not to save my life for if i had fear d death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my canker d country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou dar st not this and that to prove more fortunes th art tir d then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever follow d thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country s breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee

them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scar d the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i lov d the maid i married never man sighed truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm for t thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other s throat and wak d half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no other quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish d we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o erbear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepar d against your territories though not for rome itself coriolanus you bless me gods aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take th one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experienc d since thou know st thy country s strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in
