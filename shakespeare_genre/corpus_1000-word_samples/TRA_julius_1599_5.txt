the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are casca tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius cassius let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are govern d with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish casca indeed they say the senators to morrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure thunders still casca so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am arm d and dangers are to me indifferent casca you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering tell tale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest cassius there s a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey s porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element is favor d like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste cassius tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend enter cinna cinna where haste you so cinna to find out you who s that metellus cimber cassius no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts
