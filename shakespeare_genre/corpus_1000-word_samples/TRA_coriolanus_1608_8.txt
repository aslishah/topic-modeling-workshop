him were it at home upon my brother s guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand in s heart go you to the city learn how tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome first soldier will not you go aufidius i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you tis south the city mills bring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey first soldier i shall sir exeunt act ii scene i rome a public place enter menenius sicinius and brutus menenius the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight brutus good or bad menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends menenius pray you who does the wolf love sicinius the lamb menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius brutus he s a lamb indeed that baas like a bear menenius he s a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you both tribunes well sir menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance brutus he s poor in no one fault but stored with all sicinius especially in pride brutus and topping all others in boasting menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the right hand file do you both tribunes why how are we censured menenius because you talk of pride now will you not be angry both tribunes well well sir well menenius why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud brutus we do it not alone sir menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant like for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could both tribunes what then sir menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome sicinius menenius you are known well enough too menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in t said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too brutus come sir come we know you well enough menenius you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones brutus come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher s cushion or to be entombed in an ass s pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen god den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you brutus and sicinius retire enter volumnia virgilia valeria c how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast volumnia honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno let s go menenius ha marcius coming home volumnia ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation menenius take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home volumnia virgilia nay tis true volumnia look here s a letter
