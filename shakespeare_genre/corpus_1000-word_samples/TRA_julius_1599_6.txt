his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crown d how that might change his nature there s the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections sway d more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition s ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent s egg which hatch d would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell re enter lucius lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal d up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed brutus get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march lucius i know not sir brutus look in the calendar and bring me word lucius i will sir exit brutus the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them opens the letter and reads brutus thou sleep st awake and see thyself shall rome c speak strike redress brutus thou sleep st awake such instigations have been often dropp d where i have took them up shall rome c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man s awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was call d a king speak strike redress am i entreated then to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus re enter lucius lucius sir march is wasted fifteen days knocking within brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection re enter lucius lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you brutus is he alone lucius no sir there are more with him brutus do you know them lucius no sir their hats are pluck d about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favor brutus let em enter exit lucius they are the faction o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou pass thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention enter cassius casca decius cinna metellus cimber and trebonius cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you brutus i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you cassius yes every man of them and no man here but honors you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius brutus he is welcome hither cassius this decius brutus brutus he is welcome too cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber brutus they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night cassius shall i entreat a word brutus and cassius whisper apart decius here lies the east doth not the day break here casca no cinna o pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day casca you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here brutus give me your hands all over one by one cassius and let us swear our resolution brutus no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time s abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions
