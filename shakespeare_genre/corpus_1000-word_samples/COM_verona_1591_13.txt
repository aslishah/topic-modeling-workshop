proteus ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend duke then you must undertake to slander him proteus and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend duke where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent
