winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lour d upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums chang d to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grim visag d war hath smooth d his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady s chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shap d for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous looking glass i that am rudely stamp d and want love s majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtail d of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deform d unfinish d sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mew d up about a prophecy which says that g of edward s heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes enter clarence guarded and brakenbury brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace clarence his majesty tendering my person s safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower gloster upon what cause clarence because my name is george gloster alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be new christen d in the tower but what s the matter clarence may i know clarence yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the cross row plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these hath mov d his highness to commit me now gloster why this it is when men are rul d by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship antony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliver d we are not safe clarence we are not safe clarence by heaven i think there is no man is secure but the queen s kindred and night walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard you not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery gloster humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i ll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o er worn widow and herself since that our brother dubb d them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with your brother gloster even so an t please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore s wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing
