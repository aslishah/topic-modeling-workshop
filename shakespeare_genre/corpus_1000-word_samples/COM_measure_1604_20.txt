and isabella come forward peter now is your time speak loud and kneel before him isabella justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wrong d i d fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice duke relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him isabella o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believ d or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here angelo my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice isabella by course of justice angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo s forsworn is it not strange that angelo s a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange duke nay it is ten times strange isabella it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning duke away with her poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believ st there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touch d with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wicked st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an arch villain believe it royal prince if he be less he s nothing but he s more had i more name for badness duke by mine honesty if she be mad as i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as e er i heard in madness isabella o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true duke many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say isabella i am the sister of one claudio condemn d upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemn d by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger lucio that s i an t like your grace i came to her from claudio and desir d her to try her gracious fortune with lord

is to the matter duke mended again the matter proceed isabella in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray d and kneel d how he refell d me and how i replied for this was of

my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother s head duke this is most likely isabella o that it were as like as it is true duke by heaven fond wretch thou know st not what thou speak st or else thou art suborn d against his honour in hateful practice first his integrity stands without blemish
