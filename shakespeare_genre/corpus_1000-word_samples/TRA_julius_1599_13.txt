to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answer d it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesar s funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me first citizen methinks there is much reason
