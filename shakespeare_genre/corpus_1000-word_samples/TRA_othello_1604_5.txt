soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord duke let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robb d that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruis d heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state duke the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition othello the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding duke if you please be t at her father s brabantio i ll not have it so othello nor i desdemona nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness duke what would you desdemona desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart s subdu d even to the very quality of my lord i saw othello s visage in his mind and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him othello let her have your voices vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when light wing d toys of feather d cupid seel with wanton dullness my speculative and offic d instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation duke be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it first senator you must away to night othello with all my heart duke at nine i the morning here we ll meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you othello so
