are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words away go away exeunt act v scene i athens an apartment in the palace of theseus enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants hippolyta tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of theseus more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys

heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet s pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear hippolyta but all the story of the night told over and
