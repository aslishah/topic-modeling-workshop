passage yield like a red morn that ever yet betoken d wrack to the seaman tempest to the field sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds this ill presage advisedly she marketh even as the wind is hush d before it raineth or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh or as the berry breaks before it staineth or like the deadly bullet of a gun his meaning struck her ere his words begun and at his look she flatly falleth down for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth a smile recures the wounding of a frown but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth the silly boy believing she is dead claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red and all amaz d brake off his late intent for sharply he did think to reprehend her which cunning love did wittily prevent fair fall the wit that can so well defend her for on the grass she lies as she were slain till his breath breatheth life in her again he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr d he kisses her and she by her good will will never rise so he will kiss

me kill me once again thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain that they have murder d this poor heart of mine and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen but for thy piteous lips no more had seen long may they kiss each other for this cure o never let their crimson liveries wear and as they last their verdure still endure to drive infection from the dangerous year that the star gazers having writ on death may say the plague is banish d by thy breath pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted what bargains may i make still to be sealing to sell myself i can be well contented so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing which purchase if thou make for fear of slips set thy seal manual on my wax red lips a thousand kisses buys my heart from me and pay them at thy leisure one by one what is ten hundred touches unto thee are they not quickly told and quickly gone say for non payment that the debt should double is
