multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude third citizen we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another man s will tis strongly wedged up in a block head but if it were at liberty twould sure southward second citizen why that way third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may third citizen are you all resolved to give your voices but that s no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behaviour we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes he s to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i ll direct you how you shall go by him all content content exeunt enter coriolanus and menenius menenius o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done t coriolanus what must i say i pray sir plague upon t i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my country s service when some certain of your brethren roar d and ran from the noise of our own drums menenius o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you coriolanus think upon me hang em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by em menenius you ll mar all i ll leave you pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner coriolanus bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean exit menenius so here comes a brace re enter two citizens you know the cause sirs of my standing here first citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you to t coriolanus mine own desert second citizen your own desert coriolanus ay not mine own desire first citizen how not your own desire coriolanus no sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging first citizen you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you coriolanus well then i pray your price o the consulship first citizen the price is to ask it kindly coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me ha t i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you second citizen you shall ha it worthy sir coriolanus a match sir there s in all two worthy voices begg d i have your alms adieu first citizen but this is something odd second citizen an twere to give again but tis no matter exeunt two citizens re enter other two citizens coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown third citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly coriolanus your enigma third citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountifully to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul fourth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily third citizen you have received many wounds for your country coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily exeunt citizens coriolanus most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this wolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me to t what custom wills in all things should we do t the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heap d for truth to o erpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part suffer d the other will i do here come more voices re enter other three citizens your voices for your voices i
