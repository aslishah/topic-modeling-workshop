thereof but being over full of self affairs my mind did lose it but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both for you fair hermia look you arm

o cross too high to be enthrall d to low lysander or else misgraffed in respect of years hermia o spite too old to be engag d to young lysander or else it stood upon the choice of friends hermia o hell to choose love by another s eye lysander or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentary as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief

cupid s strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burn d the carthage queen when the
