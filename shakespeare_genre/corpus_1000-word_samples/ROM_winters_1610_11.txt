is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth hal d out to murder myself on every post proclaim d a strumpet with immodest hatred the child bed privilege denied which longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i the open air before i have got strength of limit now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die therefore proceed but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i would free if i shall be condemn d upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you tis rigour and not law your honours all i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge first lord this your request is altogether just therefore bring forth and in apollo s name his oracle exeunt certain officers hermione the emperor of russia was my father o that he were alive and here beholding his daughter s trial that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not revenge re enter officers with cleomenes and dion officer you here shall swear upon this sword of justice that you cleomenes and dion have been both at delphos and from thence have brought this seal d up oracle by the hand deliver d of great apollo s priest and that since then you have not dar d to break the holy seal nor read the secrets in t cleomenes dion all this we swear leontes break up the seals and read officer reads hermione is chaste polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found lords now blessed be the great apollo hermione praised leontes hast thou read truth officer ay my lord even so as it is here set down leontes there is no truth at all i the oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood enter a servant hastily servant my lord the king the king leontes what is the business servant o sir i shall be hated to report it the prince your son with mere conceit and fear of the queen s speed is gone leontes how gone servant is dead leontes apollo s angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice hermione faints how now there paulina this news is mortal to the queen look down and see what death is doing leontes take her hence her heart is but o ercharg d she will recover i have too much believ d mine own suspicion beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione apollo pardon my great profaneness gainst thine oracle i ll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and fill d with honour to my kingly guest unclasp d my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the certain hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honour how he glisters thorough my rust and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker re enter paulina paulina woe the while o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it break too first lord what fit is this good lady paulina what studied torments tyrant hast for me what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling in leads or oils what old or newer torture must i receive whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies fancies too weak for boys too green and idle for girls of nine o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad for all thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it that thou betray dst polixenes twas nothing that did but show thee of a fool inconstant and damnable ingrateful nor was t much thou wouldst have poison d good camillo s honour to have him kill a king poor trespasses more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter to be or none or little though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere done t nor is t directly laid to thee the death of the young prince whose honourable thoughts thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart that could conceive a gross and foolish sire blemish d his gracious dam this is not no laid to thy answer but the last o lords when i have said cry woe the queen the queen the sweetest dearest creature s dead and vengeance for t not

or breath within i ll serve you as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee to nothing but despair a thousand knees
