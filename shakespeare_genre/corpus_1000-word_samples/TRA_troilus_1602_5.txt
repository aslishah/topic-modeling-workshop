and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affin d and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strong ribb d bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse where s then the saucy boat whose weak untimber d sides but even now co rivall d greatness either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valour s show and valour s worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage as rous d with rage with rage doth sympathise and with an accent tun d in self same key retorts to chiding fortune ulysses agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks besides the applause and approbation the which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretch d out life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatch d in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienc d tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and be t of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hector s sword had lack d a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded th unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthron d and spher d amidst the other whose med cinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixture o when degree is shak d which is the ladder of all high designs the enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenity and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing melts in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then everything includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the general s disdain d by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so ever step exampl d by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discover d the fever whereof all our power is sick agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue
