higher our opinion that our stirring can from the lap of egypt s widow pluck the ne er lust wearied antony menas i cannot hope caesar and antony shall well greet together his wife that s dead did trespasses to caesar his brother warr d upon him although i think not mov d by antony pompey i know not menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater were t not that we stand up against them all twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference we yet not know be t as our gods will have t it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands come menas exeunt scene ii rome a room in the house of lepidus enter enobarbus and lepidus lepidus good enobarbus tis a worthy deed and shall become you well to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech enobarbus i shall entreat him to answer like himself if caesar move him let antony look over caesar s head and speak as loud as mars by jupiter were i the wearer of antonius beard i would not shave t to day lepidus tis not a time for private stomaching enobarbus every time serves for the matter that is then born in t lepidus but small to greater matters must give way enobarbus not if the small come first lepidus your speech is passion but pray you stir no embers up here comes the noble antony enter antony and ventidius enobarbus and yonder caesar enter caesar maecenas and agrippa antony if we compose well here to parthia hark ventidius caesar i do not know maecenas ask agrippa lepidus noble friends that which combin d us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us what s amiss may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to the matter antony tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus caesar welcome to rome antony thank you caesar sit antony sit sir caesar nay then antony i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not caesar i must be laugh d at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laugh d at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concern d me antony my being in egypt caesar what was t to you caesar no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question antony how intend you practis d caesar you may be pleas d to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war antony you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if you ll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this caesar you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patch d up your excuses antony not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain on t very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o theworld is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife enobarbus would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women antony so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it caesar i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience antony sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i the morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have ask d him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him caesar you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with lepidus soft caesar antony no lepidus let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lack d it but on caesar the article of my oath caesar to lend me arms and aid when i requir d them the which you both denied antony neglected rather and then when poison d hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may i ll play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon
