the dowry of a lawful bed time s glory is to calm contending kings to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light to stamp the seal of time in aged things to wake the morn and sentinel the night to wrong the wronger till he render right to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours and smear with dust their glittering golden towers to fill with worm holes stately monuments to feed oblivion with decay of things to blot old books and alter their contents to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings to dry the old oak s sap and cherish springs to spoil antiquities of hammer d steel and turn the giddy round of fortune s wheel to show the beldam daughters of her daughter to make the child a man the man a child to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter to tame the unicorn and lion wild
