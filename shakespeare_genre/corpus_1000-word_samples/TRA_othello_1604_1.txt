three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off capp d to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bumbast circumstance horribly stuff d with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he

attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lin d their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do

peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am roderigo what a full fortune does the thick lips owe if he can carry t thus iago call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation on t as it may lose some color roderigo here is her father s house
