how the blood of caesar follow d it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knock d or no for brutus as you know was caesar s angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquish d him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey s statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourish
