the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer poins why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition prince belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth i do now remember the poor creature small beer but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face to morrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy peach coloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use but that the tennis court keeper knows better than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and god knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened poins how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly

hypocrite prince it would be every man s thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a man s thought in the world keeps the road way better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite indeed and what accites your most worshipful thought to think so poins why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to falstaff prince and to thee poins by this light
