up in thee pyramus i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisby s face thisby thisbe my love thou art my love i think pyramus think what thou wilt i am thy lover s grace and like limander am i trusty still thisbe and i like helen till the fates me kill pyramus not shafalus to procrus was so true thisbe as shafalus to procrus i to you pyramus o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall thisbe i kiss the wall s hole not your lips at all pyramus wilt thou at ninny s tomb meet me straightway thisbe tide life tide death i come without delay wall thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go exeunt wall pyramus and thisbe theseus now is the mural down between the two neighbours demetrius no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning hippolyta this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard theseus the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them hippolyta it must be your imagination then and not theirs theseus if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a moon and a lion enter lion and moonshine lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion s dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity on my life theseus a very gentle beast and of a good conscience demetrius the very best at a beast my lord that e er i saw lysander this lion is a very fox for his valour theseus true and a goose for his discretion demetrius not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose theseus his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present demetrius he should have worn the horns on his head theseus he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference moonshine this lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the man i the moon do seem to be theseus this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lantern how is it else the man i the moon demetrius he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff hippolyta i am aweary of this moon would he would change theseus it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time lysander proceed moon moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lantern is the moon i the man i the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog demetrius why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe enter thisbe thisbe this is old ninny s tomb where is my love lion oh the lion roars thisbe runs off demetrius well roared lion theseus well run thisbe hippolyta well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace the lion tears thisbe s mantle and exit theseus well moused lion demetrius and so comes pyramus lysander and then the lion vanishes enter pyramus pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering streams i trust to take of truest thisby s sight but stay o spite but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here eyes do you see how can it be o dainty duck o dear thy mantle good what stained with blood approach ye furies fell o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail rush conclude and quell theseus this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad hippolyta beshrew my heart but i pity the man pyramus o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame since lion vile hath here deflower d my dear which is no no which was the fairest dame that liv d that lov d that lik d that look d with cheer come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop thus die i thus thus thus now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky tongue lose thy light moon take thy flight now die die die die die dies exit moonshine demetrius no die but an ace for him for he is but one lysander less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing theseus with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass hippolyta how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover theseus she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play enter thisbe hippolyta methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief demetrius a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better lysander she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes demetrius and thus she moans videlicet thisbe asleep my love what dead my dove o pyramus arise speak speak quite dumb dead
