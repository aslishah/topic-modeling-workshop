who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchester s till you hear further from his highness wolsey stay where s your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty suffolk who dares cross em bearing the king s will from his mouth expressly wolsey till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents now who ll take it surrey the king that gave it wolsey it must be himself then surrey thou art a proud traitor priest wolsey proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so surrey thy ambition thou scarlet sin robb d this bewailing land of noble buckingham my father in law the heads of all thy brother cardinals with thee and all thy best parts bound together weigh d not a hair of

absolv d him with an axe wolsey this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his

wolsey all goodness is poison to thy stomach surrey yes that goodness of gleaning all the land s wealth into one into your own hands cardinal by extortion the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king your goodness since you provoke me shall be most notorious my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble as you respect the common good the state of our despis d nobility

now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal you ll show a little honesty wolsey speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners surrey i had rather want those than my head have at you first that without the king s assent or knowledge you wrought to be a legate by which power you maim d the jurisdiction of all bishops norfolk then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscrib d in which you brought the king to be your servant suffolk then that without the knowledge either of king or council when you went ambassador to the emperor you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal surrey item you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado to conclude without the king s will or the state s allowance a league between his highness and ferrara suffolk that out of mere ambition you have caus d your holy hat to be stamp d on the king s coin surrey then that you have sent innumerable substance by what means got i leave to your own conscience to furnish rome and to prepare the ways you have for dignities to the mere undoing
