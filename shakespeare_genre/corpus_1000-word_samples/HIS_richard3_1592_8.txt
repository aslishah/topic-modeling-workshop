brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily to day clarence o i have pass d a miserable night so full of fearful dreams of ugly sights that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time brakenbury what was your dream my lord i pray you tell me clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embark d to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloster who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we look d toward england and cited up a thousand heavy times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall n us as we pac d along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloster stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main o lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in my ears what sights of ugly death within my eyes methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks a thousand men that fishes gnaw d upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatt red in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men s skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that woo d the slimy bottom of the deep and mock d the dead bones that lay scatter d by brakenbury had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon these secrets of the deep clarence methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood stopp d in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty vast and wandering air but smother d it within my panting bulk who almost burst to belch it in the sea brakenbury awak d you not in this sore agony clarence no no my dream was lengthen d after life o then began the tempest to my soul i pass d methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great father in law renowned warwick who spake aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanish d then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he shriek d out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjur d clarence that stabb d me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environ d me and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling wak d

clarence ah brakenbury i have done these things that now give evidence against my soul for edward s sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be aveng d on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children keeper i prithee sit by me awhile my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep brakenbury i will my lord god give your grace good rest clarence reposes himself on a chair sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night princes have but their titles for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imaginations they often feel a world of restless cares so that between their tides and low name there s nothing differs but the outward fame
