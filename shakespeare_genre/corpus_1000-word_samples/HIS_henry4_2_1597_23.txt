her object for this the foolish over careful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engross d and piled up the canker d heaps of strange achieved gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises when like the bee tolling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs pack d with wax our mouths with honey we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdered for our pains this bitter taste yields his engrossments to the ending father re enter warwick now where is he that will not stay so long till his friend sickness hath determin d me warwick my lord i found the prince in the next room washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks with such a deep demeanour in great sorrow

i stay too long by thee i weary thee dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth thou seek st the greatness that will overwhelm thee stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop my day is dim thou hast stolen that which after some few hours were thine without offence and at my death thou hast seal d up my expectation thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not and thou wilt have me die assured of it thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life what canst thou not forbear me half an hour then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crowned not that i am dead let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust give that which gave thee life unto the worms pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form harry the fifth is crown d up vanity down royal state all you sage counsellors hence and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness now neighbour confines purge you of your scum have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and commit the

and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours if i affect it more than as your honour and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show the incredulous world the noble change that i have purposed coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in medicine potable but thou most fine most honour d most renown d hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murder d my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
