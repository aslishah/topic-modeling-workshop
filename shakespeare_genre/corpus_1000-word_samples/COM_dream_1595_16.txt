see no such thing hippolyta he says they can do nothing in this kind theseus the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practis d accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pick d a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity enter philostrate philostrate so

doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall s chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which by name lion hight the trusty thisby coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisby s mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broach d his boiling bloody breast and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine theseus i wonder if the lion be to speak demetrius no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do wall in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisby did whisper often very secretly this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper theseus would you desire lime and hair to speak better demetrius it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord theseus
