diomedes and calchas achilles and patroclus stand in their tent ulysses achilles stands i th entrance of his tent please it our general pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last tis like he ll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent why turn d on him if so i have derision med cinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may do good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man s fees agamemnon we ll execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not look d on i will lead the way achilles what comes the general to speak with me you know my mind i ll fight no more gainst troy agamemnon what says achilles would he aught with us nestor would you my lord aught with the general

us d to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they us d to creep to holy altars achilles what am i poor of late tis certain greatness once fall n out with fortune must fall out with men too what the declin d is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches and favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that lean d on them as slippery too doth one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these men s looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses i ll interrupt his reading how now ulysses ulysses now great thetis son achilles what are you reading ulysses a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver achilles this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each other s form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travell d and is mirror d there where it may see itself this is not strange at all ulysses i do not strain at the position it is familiar but at the author s drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in th applause where th are extended who like an arch reverb rate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see to morrow an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renown d o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortune s hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into another s pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lords why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector s breast and great troy shrinking achilles i do believe it for they pass d by me as misers do by beggars neither gave to me good word nor look what are my deeds forgot ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great siz d monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devour d as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance
