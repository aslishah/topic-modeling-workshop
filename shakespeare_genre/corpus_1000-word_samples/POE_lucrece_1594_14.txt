had fainted to me came tarquin armed so beguiled with outward honesty but yet defiled with inward vice as priam him did cherish so did i tarquin so my troy did perish look look how listening priam wets his eyes to see those borrow d tears that sinon sheds priam why art thou old and yet not wise for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city such devils steal effects from lightless hell for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold and in that cold hot burning fire doth dwell these contraries such unity do hold only to flatter fools and make them bold so priam s trust false sinon s tears doth flatter that he finds means to burn his troy with water here all enraged such passion her assails that patience is quite beaten from her breast she tears the senseless sinon with her nails comparing him to that unhappy guest whose deed hath made herself herself detest at last she smilingly with this gives o er fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow and time doth weary time with her complaining she looks for night and then she longs for morrow and both she thinks too long with her remaining short time seems long in sorrow s sharp sustaining though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps and they that watch see time how slow it creeps which all this time hath overslipp d her thought that she with painted images hath spent being from the feeling of her own grief brought by deep surmise of others detriment losing her woes in shows of discontent it easeth some though none it ever cured to think their dolour others have endured but now the mindful messenger come back brings home his lord and other company who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black and round about her tear distained eye blue circles stream d like rainbows in the sky these water galls in her dim element foretell new storms to those already spent which when her sad beholding husband saw amazedly in her sad face he stares her eyes though sod in tears look d red and raw her lively colour kill d with deadly cares he hath no power to ask her how she fares both stood like old acquaintance in a trance met far from home wondering each other s chance at last he takes her by the bloodless hand and thus begins what uncouth ill event hath thee befall n that thou dost trembling stand sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent why art thou thus attired in discontent unmask dear dear this moody heaviness and tell thy grief that we may give redress three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire ere once she can discharge one word of woe at length address d to answer his desire she modestly prepares to let them know her honour is ta en prisoner by the foe while collatine and his consorted lords with sad attention long to hear her words and now this pale swan in her watery nest begins the sad dirge of her certain ending few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best where no excuse can give the fault amending in me moe woes than words are now depending and my laments would be drawn out too long to tell them all with one poor tired tongue then be this all the task it hath to say dear husband in the interest of thy bed a stranger came and on that pillow lay where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head and what wrong else may be imagined by foul enforcement might be done to me from that alas thy lucrece is not free for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight with shining falchion in my chamber came a creeping creature with a flaming light and softly cried awake thou roman dame and entertain my love else lasting shame on thee and thine this night i will inflict if thou my love s desire do contradict for some hard favour d groom of thine quoth he unless thou yoke thy liking to my will i ll murder straight and then i ll slaughter thee and swear i found you where you did fulfil the loathsome act of lust and so did kill the lechers in their deed this act will be my fame and thy perpetual infamy with this i did begin to start and cry and then against my heart he sets his sword swearing unless i took all patiently i should not live to speak another word so should my shame still rest upon record and never be forgot in mighty rome th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom mine enemy was strong my poor self weak and far the weaker with so strong a fear my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak no rightful plea might plead for justice there his scarlet lust came evidence to swear that my poor beauty had purloin d his eyes and when the judge is robb d the prisoner dies o teach me how to make mine own excuse or at the least this refuge let me find though my gross blood be stain d with this abuse immaculate and spotless is my mind that was not forced that never was inclined to accessary yieldings but still pure doth in her poison d closet yet endure lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss with head declined and voice damm d up with woe with sad set eyes and wretched arms across from lips new waxen pale begins to blow the grief away that stops his
