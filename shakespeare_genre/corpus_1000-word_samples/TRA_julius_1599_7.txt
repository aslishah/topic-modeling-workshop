and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass d from him cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us casca let us not leave him out cinna no by no means metellus o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men s voices to commend our deeds it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity brutus o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin cassius then leave him out casca indeed he is not fit decius shall no man else be touch d but only caesar cassius decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar s spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends let s kill him boldly but not wrathfully let s carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall mark our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be call d purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar s arm when caesar s head is off cassius yet i do fear him for in th ingrafted love he bears to caesar brutus alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter clock strikes brutus peace count the clock cassius the clock hath stricken three trebonius tis time to part cassius but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustom d terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol to day decius never fear that if he be so resolved i can o ersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray d with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered let me work for i can give his humor the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him brutus by the eighth hour is that the uttermost cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then metellus caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him brutus now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reason send him but hither and i ll fashion him cassius the morning comes upon s we ll leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one exeunt all but brutus boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep st so sound enter portia portia brutus my lord brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning portia nor for yours neither you ve ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walk d about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i ask d you what the matter was you stared upon me with ungentle looks i urged you further then you scratch d your head and too impatiently stamp d with your foot yet i insisted yet you answer d not but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem d too much enkindled
