thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy king henry call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolv d and by god s help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we ll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there we ll sit ruling in large and ample empery o er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshipp d with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepar d to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king first ambassador may t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin s meaning and our embassy king henry we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fett red in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin s mind ambassador thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advis d there s nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks king henry what treasure uncle exeter tennis balls my liege king henry we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have match d our rackets to these balls we will in france by god s grace play a set shall strike his father s crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb d with chaces and we understand him well how he comes o er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valu d this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn d his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin s scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow d cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors exeter this was a merry message king henry we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we ll chide this dauphin at his father s door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt act ii prologue flourish enter chorus chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies now thrive the armourers and honour s thought reigns solely in the breast of every man they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with winged heels as english mercuries for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial crowns and coronets promis d to harry and his followers the french advis d by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation shake in their fear and with pale policy seek to divert the english purposes o england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what mightst thou do that honour would thee do were all thy children kind and natural but see thy fault france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men one richard earl of cambridge
