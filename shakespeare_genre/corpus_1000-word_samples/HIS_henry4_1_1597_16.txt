shall presently have need of you exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he ll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark d for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such base such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art match d withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart prince so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised by smiling pick thanks and base news mongers which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wander d and irregular find pardon on my true submission king god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place

s hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne er seen but wonder d at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capering fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoff d himself to popularity that being dally swallow d by men s eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sun like majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and render d such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry stand st thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is a weary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness prince i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself king for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurg and even as i was then is percy now
