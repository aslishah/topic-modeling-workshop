realm of france warwick be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alencon bastard reignier and others charles since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim d in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be york speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison d voice by sight of these our baleful enemies cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute and submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy the regal dignity alencon must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless charles tis known already that i am possess d with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish d detract so much from that prerogative as to be call d but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador i ll rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all york insulting charles hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise stand st thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurp st of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars reignier my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity alencon to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves warwick how say st thou charles shall our condition stand charles it shall only reserv d you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison york then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene v london the royal palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonish d me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love s settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love suffolk tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous intents to love and honor henry as her lord king and otherwise will henry ne er presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england s royal queen gloucester so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betroth d unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honor with reproach suffolk as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vow d to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary s odds a poor earl s daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offense gloucester why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel suffolk yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance gloucester and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles exeter beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferr d for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret
