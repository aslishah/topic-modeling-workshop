constant cimber should be banish d and constant do remain to keep him so cinna o caesar caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus decius great caesar caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel casca speak hands for me casca stabs caesar in the neck caesar catches hold of his arm he is then stabbed by several other conspirators and at last by marcus brutus caesar et tu brute then fall caesar dies the senators and people retire in confusion cinna liberty freedom tyranny is dead run hence proclaim cry it about the streets cassius some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement brutus people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambition s debt is paid casca go to the pulpit brutus decius and cassius too brutus where s publius cinna here quite confounded with this mutiny metellus stand fast together lest some friend of caesar s should chance brutus talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius cassius and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief brutus do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers re enter trebonius cassius where s antony trebonius fled to his house amazed men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday brutus fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon casca why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death brutus grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar s friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar s blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the market place and waving our red weapons o er our heads let s all cry peace freedom and liberty cassius stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted o er in states unborn and accents yet unknown brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey s basis lies along no worthier than the dust cassius so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us

noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving say i love brutus and i honor him say i fear d caesar honour d him and loved him if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith so says my master antony brutus thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honour depart untouch d servant i ll fetch him presently exit brutus i know that we shall have him well to friend cassius i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose brutus but here comes antony re enter antony welcome mark antony antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar s death hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no means of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age brutus o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of amity and our hearts of brothers temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence cassius
