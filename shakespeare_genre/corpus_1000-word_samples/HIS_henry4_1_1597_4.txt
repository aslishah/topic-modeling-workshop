strength denied as is deliver d to your majesty either envy therefore or misprision is guilty of this fault and not my son hot my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat trimly dress d fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap d show d like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took t away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk d and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he call d them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he question d me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty s behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold out of my grief and my impatience to be so pester d with a popinjay answer d neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for t made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark and telling me the sovereign st thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous salt petre should be digg d out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroy d so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty blunt the circumstance consider

hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer hot revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn s sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn s flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stained with these valiant combatants never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slander d with revolt king thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with
