grosser manner of these world s delights he throws upon the gross world s baser slaves to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die with all these living in philosophy berowne i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep king your oath is pass d to pass away from these berowne let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years

study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if study s gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will ne er say no king these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight berowne why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchas d doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heaven s glorious sun that will not be deep search d with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heaven s lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name king how well he s read to reason against reading dumaine proceeded well to stop all good proceeding longaville he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding berowne the spring is near when green geese are a breeding dumaine how follows that berowne fit in his place and time dumaine in reason nothing berowne something then in rime longaville berowne is like an envious sneaping frost that bites the first born infants of the spring
