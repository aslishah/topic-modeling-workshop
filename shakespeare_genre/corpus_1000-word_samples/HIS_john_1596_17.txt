contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattailed and rank d in kent another lean unwash d artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthur s death king john why seek st thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur s death thy hand hath murder d him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him hubert no had my lord why did you not provoke me king john it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advis d respect hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did king john o when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature mark d quoted and sign d to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorr d aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employ d in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur s death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hubert my lord king john hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause when i spake darkly what i purpos d or turn d an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is brav d even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of the fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin s death hubert arm you against your other enemies i ll make a peace between your soul and you young arthur is alive this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand not painted with the crimson spots of blood within this bosom never enter d yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought and you have slander d nature in my form which howsoever rude exteriorly is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child king john doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt scene the same before the castle enter arthur on the walls arthur the wall is high and yet will i leap down good ground be pitiful and hurt me not there s few or none do know me if they did this ship boy s
