distractedly rivers and dorset following her queen elizabeth ah who shall hinder me to wail and weep to chide my fortune and torment myself i ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy duchess what means this scene of rude impatience queen elizabeth to make an act of tragic violence edward my lord thy son our king is dead why grow the branches when the root is gone why wither not the leaves that want their sap if you will live lament if die be brief that our swift winged souls may catch the king s or like obedient subjects follow him to his new kingdom of perpetual rest duchess ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband i have bewept a worthy husband s death and liv d by looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack d in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass that grieves me when i see my shame in him thou art a widow yet thou art a mother and hast the comfort of thy children left but death hath snatch d my husband from mine arms and pluck d two crutches from my feeble hands clarence and edward o what cause have i thine being but a moiety of my moan

elizabeth what stay had i but edward and he s gone children what stay had we but clarence and he s gone duchess what stays had i but they and they are gone queen elizabeth was never widow had so dear a loss children were never orphans had so dear a loss duchess was never mother had so dear a loss alas i am the mother of these griefs their woes are parcell d mine is general she for an edward weeps

sorrow s nurse and i will pamper it with lamentation dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeas d that you take with unthankfulness his doing in common worldly things tis called ungrateful with dull unwillingness to repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent much more to be thus opposite with heaven for it requires the royal debt it lent you rivers madam bethink you like a careful mother of the young prince your son send straight for him let him be crown d in him your comfort lives drown desperate sorrow in dead edward s grave and plant your joys in living edward s throne enter gloster buckingham stanley hastings ratcliff and others gloster sister have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can help our harms by wailing them madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing duchess god bless thee and put meekness in thy breast love charity obedience and true duty gloster amen aside and make me die a good old man that is the butt end of a mother s blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out buckingham you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each other s love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancour of your high swoln hearts but lately splinter d knit and join d together must gently be preserv d cherish d and kept me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetched hither to london to be crown d our king rivers why with some little train my lord of buckingham buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude the new heal d wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern d where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented gloster i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me rivers and so in me and so i think in all yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urg d therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince hastings and so say i gloster then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this business exeunt all but buckingham and gloster buckingham my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god d sake let not us two stay at home for by
