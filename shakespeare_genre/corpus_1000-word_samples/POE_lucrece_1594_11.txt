resolution love shall be thy boast by whose example thou revenged mayst be how tarquin must be used read it in me myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so this brief abridgement of my will i make my soul and body to the skies and ground my resolution husband do thou take mine honour be the knife s that makes my wound my shame be his that did my fame

victors be this plot of death when sadly she had laid and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid whose swift obedience to her mistress hies for fleet wing d duty with thought s feathers flies poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow her mistress she doth give demure good morrow with soft slow tongue true mark of modesty and sorts a sad look to her lady s sorrow for why her face wore sorrow s livery but durst not ask of her audaciously why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so nor why her fair cheeks over wash d with woe but as the earth doth weep the sun being set each flower moisten d like a melting eye even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet her circled eyne enforced by sympathy of those fair suns set in her mistress sky who in a salt waved ocean quench their light which makes the maid weep like the dewy night a pretty while these pretty creatures stand like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling one justly weeps the other takes in hand no cause but company of her drops spilling their gentle sex to weep are often willing grieving themselves to guess at others smarts and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts for men have marble women waxen minds and therefore are they form d as marble will the weak oppress d the impression of strange kinds is form d in them by force by fraud or skill then call them not the authors of their ill no more than wax shall be accounted evil wherein is stamp d the semblance of a devil their smoothness like a goodly campaign plain lays open all the little worms that creep in men as in a rough grown grove remain cave keeping evils that obscurely sleep through crystal walls each little mote will peep though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks poor women s faces are their own faults books no man inveigb against the wither d flower but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill d not that devour d but that which doth devour is worthy blame o let it not be hild poor women s faults that they are so fulfill d with men s abuses those proud lords to blame make weak made women tenants to their shame the precedent whereof in lucrece view assail d by night with circumstances strong of present death and shame that might ensue by that her death to do her husband wrong such danger to resistance did belong the dying fear through all her body spread and who cannot abuse a body dead by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak to the poor counterfeit of her complaining my girl quoth she on what occasion break those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining know gentle wench it small avails my mood if tears could help mine own would do me good but tell me girl when went and there she stay d till after a deep groan tarquin from hence madam ere i was up replied the maid the more to blame my sluggard negligence yet with the fault i thus far can dispense myself was stirring ere the break of day and ere i rose was tarquin gone away but lady if your maid may be so bold she would request to know your heaviness o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told the repetition cannot make it less for more it is than i can well express and that deep torture may be call d a hell when more is felt than one hath power to tell go get me hither paper ink and pen yet save that labour for i have them here what should i say one of my husband s men bid thou be ready by and by to bear a letter to my lord my love my dear bid him with speed prepare to carry it the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ her maid is gone and she prepares to write first hovering o er the paper with her quill conceit and grief an eager combat fight what wit sets down is blotted straight with will this is too curious good this blunt and ill much like a press
