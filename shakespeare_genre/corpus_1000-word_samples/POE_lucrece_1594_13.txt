imaginary work was there conceit deceitful so compact so kind that for achilles image stood his spear griped in an armed hand himself behind was left unseen save to the eye of mind a hand a foot a face a leg a head stood for the whole to be imagined and from the walls of strong besieged troy when their brave hope bold hector march d to field stood many trojan mothers sharing joy to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield and to their hope they such odd action yield that through their light joy seemed to appear like bright things stain d a kind of heavy fear and from the strand of dardan where they fought to simois reedy banks the red blood ran whose waves to imitate the battle sought with swelling ridges and their ranks began to break upon the galled shore and than retire again till meeting greater ranks they join and shoot their foam at simois banks to this well painted piece is lucrece come to find a face where all distress is stell d many she sees where cares have carved some but none where all distress and dolour dwell d till she despairing hecuba beheld staring on priam s wounds with her old eyes which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies in her the painter had anatomized time s ruin beauty s wreck and grim cares reign her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised of what she was no semblance did remain her blue blood changed to black in every vein wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed show d life imprison d in a body dead on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes and shapes her sorrow to the bedlam s woes who nothing wants to answer her but cries and bitter words to ban her cruel foes the painter was no god to lend her those and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong to give her so much grief and not a tongue poor instrument quoth she without a sound i ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue and drop sweet balm in priam s painted wound and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong and with my tears quench troy that burns so long and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes of all the greeks that are thine enemies show me the strumpet that began this stir that with my nails her beauty i may tear thy heat of lust fond paris did incur this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here and here in troy for trespass of thine eye the sire the son the dame and daughter die why should the private pleasure of some one become the public plague of many moe let sin alone committed light alone upon his head that hath transgressed so let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe for one s offence why should so many fall to plague a private sin in general lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies here manly hector faints here troilus swounds here friend by friend in bloody channel lies and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds and one man s lust these many lives confounds had doting priam check d his son s desire troy had been bright with fame and not with fire here feelingly she weeps troy s painted woes for sorrow like a heavy hanging bell once set on ringing with his own weight goes then little strength rings out the doleful knell so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell to pencill d pensiveness and colour d sorrow she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow she throws her eyes about the painting round and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament at last she sees a wretched image bound that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent his face though full of cares yet show d content onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes so mild that patience seem d to scorn his woes in him the painter labour d with his skill to hide deceit and give the harmless show an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still a brow unbent that seem d to welcome woe cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so that blushing red no guilty instance gave nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have but like a constant and confirmed devil he entertain d a show so seeming just and therein so ensconced his secret evil that jealousy itself cold not mistrust false creeping craft and perjury should thrust into so bright a day such black faced storms or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms the well skill d workman this mild image drew for perjured sinon whose enchanting story the credulous old priam after slew whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry and little stars shot from their fixed places when their glass fell wherein they view d their faces this picture she advisedly perused and chid the painter for his wondrous skill saying some shape in sinon s was abused so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill and still on him she gazed and gazing still such signs of truth in his plain face she spied that she concludes the picture was belied it cannot be quoth she that so much guile she would have said can lurk in such a look but tarquin s shape came in her mind the while and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took it cannot be she in that sense forsook and turn d it thus it cannot be i find but such a face should bear a wicked mind for even as subtle sinon here is painted so sober sad so weary and so mild as if with grief or travail he
