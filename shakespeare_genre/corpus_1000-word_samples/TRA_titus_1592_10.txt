tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome s great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watch d and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemned sons whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honour s lofty bed throwing himself on the ground for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart s deep languor and my soul s sad tears let my tears stanch the earth s dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush exeunt senators tribunes c with the prisoners o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer s drought i ll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i ll melt the snow and keep eternal spring time on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear

lucius o noble father you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not no man is by and you recount your sorrows to a stone titus ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead grave tribunes once more i entreat of you lucius my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak titus why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they

stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death rises but wherefore stand st thou with thy weapon drawn lucius to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounc d my everlasting doom of banishment titus o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished but who comes with our brother marcus here enter marcus and lavinia marcus titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep or if not so thy noble heart to break i bring consuming sorrow to thine age titus will it consume me let me see it then marcus this was thy daughter titus why marcus so she is lucius ay me this object kills me titus faint hearted boy arise and look upon her speak my lavinia what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father s sight what fool hath added water to
