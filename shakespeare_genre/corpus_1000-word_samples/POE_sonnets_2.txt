world doth spend shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it but beauty s waste hath in the world an end and kept unused the user so destroys it no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murd rous shame commits x for shame deny that thou bear st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident grant if thou wilt thou art belov d of many but that thou none lov st is most evident for thou art so possess d with murderous hate that gainst thy self thou stick st not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire o change thy thought that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodg d than gentle love be as thy presence is gracious and kind or to thyself at least kind hearted prove make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee xi as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow st in one of thine from that which thou departest and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow st thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest herein lives wisdom beauty and increase without this folly age and cold decay if all were minded so the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away let those whom nature hath not made for store harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish look whom she best endow d she gave thee more which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish she carv d thee for her seal and meant thereby thou shouldst print more not let that copy die xii when i do count the clock that tells the time and see the brave day sunk in hideous night when i behold the violet past prime and sable curls all silvered o er with white when lofty trees i see barren of leaves which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer s green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow and nothing gainst time s scythe can make defence save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence xiii o that you were your self but love you are no longer yours than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination then you were yourself again after yourself s decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winter s day and barren rage of death s eternal cold o none but unthrifts dear my love you know you had a father let your son say so xiv not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues of dearths or seasons quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert or else of thee this i prognosticate thy end is truth s and beauty s doom and date xv when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the self same sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new xvi but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme now stand you on the top of happy hours and many maiden gardens yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this time s pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men to give away yourself keeps yourself still and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill xvii who will believe my verse in time to come if it were fill d with your most high deserts though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life and shows not half your parts if i could write the beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say this poet lies such heavenly touches ne er touch d earthly faces so should my papers yellow d with their age be scorn d like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be term d a poet s rage and stretched metre of an antique song but were some child of yours alive that time you should live twice in it and in my rhyme xviii shall
