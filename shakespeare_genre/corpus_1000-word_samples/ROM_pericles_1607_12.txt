letters who hath gain d of education all the grace which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marina s life seeks to take off by treason s knife and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter and a wench full grown even ripe for marriage rite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be be t when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the night bird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleon s wife with envy rare

weeping for her only mistress death thou art resolved leonine i am resolved enter marina with a basket of flowers marina
