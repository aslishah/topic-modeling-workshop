agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration that s done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsy fumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as

like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member

tucket agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus menelaus from troy enter aeneas agamemnon what would you fore our tent aeneas is this great agamemnon s tent i pray you agamemnon even this aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly eyes agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles an fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general aeneas fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals agamemnon how aeneas ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon agamemnon this troyan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarm d as bending angels that s their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and jove s accord nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace troyan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the prais d himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas aeneas ay greek that is my name agamemnon what s your affair i pray you aeneas sir pardon tis for agamemnon s ears agame he hears nought privately that comes from troy aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper with him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak agamemnon speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnon s sleeping hour that thou shalt know troyan he is awake he tells thee so himself aeneas trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud sound trumpet we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince called hector priam is his father who in this dull and long continued truce is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fair st of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers to him this challenge hector in view of troyans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did couple in his arms and will to morrow with his trumpet call mid way between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none he ll say
