can not all she listeth what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering and yields at last to every light impression things out of hope are compass d oft with venturing chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission affection faints not like a pale fac d coward but then woos best when most his choice is froward when he did frown o had she then gave over such nectar from his lips she had not suck d foul words and frowns must not repel a lover what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluck d were beauty under twenty locks kept fast yet love breaks through and picks them all at last for pity now she can no more detain him the poor fool prays her that he may depart she is resolv d no longer to restrain him bids him farewell and look well to her heart the which by cupid s bow she doth protest he carries thence incaged in his breast sweet boy she says this night i ll waste in sorrow for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch tell me love s master shall we meet to morrow say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match he tells her no to morrow he intends to hunt the boar with certain of his friends the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose usurps her cheeks she trembles at his tale and on his neck her yoking arms she throws she sinketh down still hanging by his neck he on her belly falls she on her back now is she in the very lists of love her champion mounted for the hot encounter all is imaginary she doth prove he will not manage her although he mount her that worse than tantalus is her annoy to clip elysium and to lack her joy even as poor birds deceiv d with painted grapes do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw even so she languisheth in her mishaps as those poor birds that helpless berries saw the warm effects which she in him finds missing she seeks to kindle with continual kissing but all in vain good queen it will not be she hath assay d as much as may be prov d her pleading hath deserv d a greater fee she s love she loves and yet she is not lov d fie fie he says you crush me let me go you have no reason to withhold me so thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this but that thou told st me thou wouldst hunt the boar o be advis d thou know st not what it is with javelin s point a churlish swine to gore whose tushes never sheath d he whetteth still like to a mortal butcher bent to kill on his bow back he hath a battle set of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes his eyes like glow worms shine when he doth fret his snout digs sepulchres where er he goes being mov d he strikes whate er is in his way and whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm d are better proof than thy spear s point can enter his short thick neck cannot be easily harm d being ireful on the lion he will venture the thorny brambles and embracing bushes as fearful of him part through whom he rushes alas he nought esteems that face of thine to which love s eyes pay tributary gazes nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne whose full perfection all the world amazes but having thee at vantage wondrous dread would root these beauties as he roots the mead o let him keep his loathsome cabin still beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends come not within his danger by thy will they that thrive well take counsel of their friends when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble i fear d thy fortune and my joints did tremble didst thou not mark my face was it not white saw st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye grew i not faint and fell i not downright within my bosom whereon thou dost lie my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast for where love reigns disturbing jealousy doth call himself affection s sentinel gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill distempering gentle love in his desire as air and water do abate the fire this sour informer this bate breeding spy this canker that eats up love s tender spring this carry tale dissentious jealousy that sometime true news sometime false doth bring knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear that if i love thee i thy death should fear and more than so presenteth to mine eye the picture of an angry chafing boar under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie an image like thyself all stain d with gore whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed doth make them droop with grief and hang the head what should i do seeing thee so indeed that tremble at the imagination the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed and fear doth teach it divination i prophesy thy death my living sorrow if thou encounter with the boar to morrow but if thou needs wilt hunt be rul d by me uncouple at the timorous flying hare or at the fox which lives by subtilty or at the roe which no encounter dare pursue these fearful creatures o er the downs and on thy well breath d horse keep with thy hound and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles how he outruns the winds
