bred thou art no man though of a man s complexion for men will kiss even by their own direction this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue and swelling passion doth provoke a pause red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong being judge in love she cannot right her cause and now she weeps and now she fain would speak and now her sobs do her intendments break sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand now gazeth she on him now on the ground sometimes her arms infold him like a band she would he will not in her arms be bound and when from thence he struggles to be gone she locks her lily fingers one in one fondling she saith since i have hemm d thee here within the circuit of this ivory pale i ll be a park and thou shalt be my deer feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale graze on my lips and if those hills be dry stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie within this limit is relief enough sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough to shelter thee from tempest and from rain then be my deer since i am such a park no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark at this adonis smiles as in disdain that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple love made those hollows if himself were slain he might be buried in a tomb so simple foreknowing well if there he came to lie why there love liv d and there he could not die these lovely caves these round enchanting pits open d their mouths to swallow venus liking being mad before how doth she now for wits struck dead at first what needs a second striking poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn now which way shall she turn what shall she say her words are done her woes the more increasing the time is spent her object will away and from her twining arms doth urge releasing pity she cries some favour some remorse away he springs and hasteth to his horse but lo from forth a copse that neighbours by a breeding jennet lusty young and proud adonis tramping courier doth espy and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud the strong neck d steed being tied unto a tree breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds and now his woven girths he breaks asunder the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds whose hollow womb resounds like heaven s thunder the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth controlling what he was controlled with his ears up prick d his braided hanging mane upon his compass d crest now stand on end his nostrils drink the air and forth again as from a furnace vapours doth he send his eye which scornfully glisters like fire shows his hot courage and his high desire sometime he trots as if he told the steps with gentle majesty and modest pride anon he rears upright curvets and leaps as who should say lo thus my strength is tried and this i do to captivate the eye of the fair breeder that is standing by what recketh he his rider s angry stir his flattering holla or his stand i say what cares he now for curb or pricking spur for rich caparisons or trapping gay he sees his love and nothing else he sees nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees look when a painter would surpass the life in limning out a well proportion d steed his art with nature s workmanship at strife as if the dead the living should exceed so did this horse excel a common one in shape in courage colour pace and bone round hoof d short jointed fetlocks shag and long broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide look what a horse should have he did not lack save a proud rider on so proud a back sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares anon he starts at stirring of a feather to bid the wind a base he now prepares and whe r he run or fly they know not whether for through his mane and tail the high wind sings fanning the hairs who wave like feather d wings he looks upon his love and neighs unto her she answers him as if she knew his mind being proud as females are to see him woo her she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels beating his kind embracements with her heels then like a melancholy malcontent he vails his tail that like a falling plume cool shadow to his melting buttock lent he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume his love perceiving how he is enrag d grew kinder and his fury was assuag d his testy master goeth about to take him when lo the unback d breeder full of fear jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him with her the horse and left adonis there as they were mad unto the wood they hie them outstripping crows that strive to overfly them all swoln with chafing down adonis sits banning his boisterous and unruly beast and now the happy season once more fits that love sick love by pleading may be blest for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong when it is barr d the aidance of the tongue an oven that is stopp d or river stay d burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage so of concealed sorrow may be said free vent of words love s
