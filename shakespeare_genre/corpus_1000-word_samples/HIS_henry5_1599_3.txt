hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp d from you and your progenitors king henry may i with right and conscience make this claim canterbury the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your great grandsire s tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle s edward the black prince who on the french ground play d a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion s whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action ely awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises exeter your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood westmoreland they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion d in the fields of france canterbury o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors king henry we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages canterbury they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers king henry we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish d kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood canterbury she hath been then more fear d than harm d my liege for hear her but exampl d by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward s fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries westmoreland but there s a saying very old and true if that you will france win
