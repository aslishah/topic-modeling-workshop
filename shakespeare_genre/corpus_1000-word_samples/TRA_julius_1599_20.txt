shall speak together what are you then determined to do brutus even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below cassius then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made cassius for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again we ll smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made brutus why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this day s business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away exeunt scene ii the same the field of battle alarum enter brutus and messala brutus ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down exeunt scene iii another part of the field alarum enter cassius and titinius cassius o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turn d enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him titinius o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclosed enter pindarus pindarus fly further off my lord fly further off mark antony is in your tents my lord fly therefore noble cassius fly far off cassius this hill is far enough look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire titinius they are my lord cassius titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy titinius i will be here again even with a thought exit cassius go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou notest about the field pindarus goes up this day i breathed first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass sirrah what news pindarus above o my lord cassius what news pindarus above titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen that make to him on the spur yet he spurs on now they are almost on him now titinius now some light o he lights too he s ta en shout and hark they shout for joy cassius come down behold no more o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta en before my face pindarus descends come hither sirrah in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar s bowels search this bosom stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is cover d as tis now guide thou the sword caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that kill d thee dies pindarus so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will o cassius far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him exit re enter titinius with messala messala it is but change titinius for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus power as cassius legions are by antony titinius these tidings would well comfort cassius messala where did you leave him titinius all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill messala is not that he that lies upon the ground titinius he lies not like the living o my heart messala is not that he titinius no this was he messala but cassius is no more o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night so in his red blood cassius day is set the sun of rome is set our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done mistrust of my success hath done this deed messala mistrust of good success hath done this deed o hateful error melancholy s child why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not o error soon conceived thou never comest unto a happy birth but kill st the mother that engender d thee titinius what pindarus where art thou pindarus messala seek him titinius whilst i go to meet the noble brutus thrusting this report into his ears i may say thrusting it for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight titinius hie you messala and i will seek for pindarus the while exit messala why didst thou send me forth brave cassius did i not meet thy friends and did not they put on my brows this wreath
