rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me pol come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late oph no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me pol that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king
