cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still takes hold of the hand of the princess were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he s no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who finger d to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being play d upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you antiochus prince pericles touch not upon thy life for that s an article within our law as dangerous as the rest tour time s expired either expound now or receive your sentence pericles great king few love to hear the sins they love to act twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do he s more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind blows dust in others eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts copp d hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng d by man s oppression and the poor worm doth die for t kind are earth s gods in vice their law s their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head antiochus aside heaven that i had thy head he has found the meaning but i will gloze with him young prince of tyre though by the tenour of our strict edict your exposition misinterpreting we might proceed to cancel of your days yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree as your fair self doth tune us otherwise forty days longer we do respite you if by which time our secret be undone this mercy shows we ll joy in such a son and until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honour and your worth exeunt all but pericles peracles how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you re both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasure fits an husband not a father and she an eater of her mother s flesh by the defiling of her parent s bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murder s as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropp d to keep you clear by flight i ii shun the danger which i fear exit re enter antiochus antiochus he gath found the meaning for which we mean to have his head he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy nor tell the world antiochus doth sin in such a loathed manner and therefore instantly this prince must die for by his fall my honour must keep high who attends us there enter thaliard thaliard doth your highness call antiochus thaliard you are of our chamber and our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy and for your faithfulness we will advance you thaliard behold here s poison and here s gold we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him it fits thee not to ask the reason why because we bid it say is it done thaliard my lord tis done antiochus enough enter a messenger let your breath cool yourself telling your haste messenger my lord prlnce pericles is fled exit antiochus as thou wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot from a well experienced archer hits the mark his eye doth level at so thou ne er return unless thou say prince pericles is dead thaliard my lord if i can get him within my pistol s length i ll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness antiochus thaliard adieu exit thaliard till pericles be dead my heart can lend no succour to my head exit scene ii tyre a room in the palace enter pericles pericles to lords without let none disturb us why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day s glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i fear d is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure s art can joy my spirits nor yet the other s distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by mis dread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might he done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me
