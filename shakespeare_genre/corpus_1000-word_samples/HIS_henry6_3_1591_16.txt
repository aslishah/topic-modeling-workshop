and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england s king in lawful marriage queen margaret aside if that go forward henry s hope is done warwick to bona and gracious madam in our king s behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign s heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath plac d thy beauty s image and thy virtue queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edward s well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry s son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom s worth oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellow d years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york king lewis queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick queen margaret heavens grant that warwick s words bewitch him not they stand aloof king lewis now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour king lewis but is he gracious in the people s eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunate lewis then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona warwick such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix d in virtue s ground the leaves and fruit maintain d with beauty s sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain lewis now sister let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant or your denial shall be mine yet i confess to warwick that often ere this day when i have heard your king s desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire king lewis then warwick thus our sister shall be edward s and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpois d draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king prince to edward but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry s friend king lewis and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward s good success then t is but reason that i be releas d from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better t were you troubled him than france queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord s false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather a horn sounded within king lewis warwick this is some post to us or thee enter the post post my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague these from our king unto your majesty and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while
