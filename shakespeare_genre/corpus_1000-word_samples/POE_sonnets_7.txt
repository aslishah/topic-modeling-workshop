can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return of posting is no need o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed n motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfect st love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade since from thee going he went wilful slow towards thee i ll run and give him leave to go lii so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in that long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant special blest by new unfolding his imprison d pride blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope liii what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen s cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart liv o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summer s breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwoo d and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade by verse distills your truth lv not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmear d with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor war s quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgment that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes lvi sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but to day by feeding is allay d to morrow sharpened in his former might so love be thou although to day thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness to morrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view or call it winter which being full of care makes summer s welcome thrice more wished more rare lvii being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do anything he thinks no ill lviii that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand the account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure o let me suffer being at your beck the imprison d absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury be where you list your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of self doing crime i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well lix if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguil d which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child o that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder
