like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty canterbury it must be so for miracles are ceas d and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected ely but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urg d by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no canterbury he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have open d to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal ely how did this offer seem receiv d my lord canterbury with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceiv d his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france deriv d from edward his great grandfather ely what was the impediment that broke this off canterbury the french ambassador upon that instant crav d audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four o clock ely it is canterbury then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it ely i ll wait upon you and i long to hear it exeunt scene ii the same the presence chamber enter king henry gloucester bedford exeter warwick westmoreland and attendants king henry where is my gracious lord of canterbury exeter not here in presence king henry send for him good uncle westmoreland shall we call in the ambassador my liege king henry not yet my cousin we would be resolv d before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely canterbury god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it king henry sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience wash d as pure as sin with baptism canterbury then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdu d the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish d then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call d meisen then doth it well appear the salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly suppos d the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdu d the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurp d the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey d himself as the heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer s sun king pepin s title and hugh capet s claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to
