hiss d him in scorn while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more and fought on part and part till the prince came who parted either part lady montague o where is romeo saw you him to day right glad i am he was not at this fray benvolio madam an hour before the worshipp d sun peer d forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city s side so early walking did i see your son towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i measuring his affections by my own that most are busied when they re most alone pursu d my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunn d who gladly fled from me montague many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning s dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the all cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora s bed away from light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous

means montague both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himself i will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know benvolio see where he comes so please you step aside i ll know his grievance or be much denied montague i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift come madam let s away exeunt
