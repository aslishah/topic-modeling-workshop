words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told lxxvii thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dial s shady stealth mayst know time s thievish progress to eternity look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed deliver d from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book lxxviii so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned s wing and given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance lxxix whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decay d and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay lxxx o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame but since your worth wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wrack d i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay lxxxi or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in men s eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall o er read and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall live such virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men lxxxii i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint o erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time bettering days and do so love yet when they have devis d what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathiz d in true plain words by thy true telling friend and their gross painting might be better us d where cheeks need blood in thee it is abus d lxxxiii i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed that barren tender of a poet s debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise lxxxiv who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse lxxxv my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compil d reserve their character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses fil d i think good thoughts whilst others write good words and like
