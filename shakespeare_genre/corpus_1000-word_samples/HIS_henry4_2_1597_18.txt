commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular westmoreland there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you mowbray why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours westmoreland o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessities and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on were you not restored to all the duke of norfolk s signories your noble and right well rememb red father s mowbray what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revived and breathed in me the king that loved him as the state stood then was force perforce compell d to banish him and then that henry bolingbroke and he being mounted and both roused in their seats their neighing coursers daring of the spur their armed staves in charge their beavers down their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel and the loud trumpet blowing them together then then when there was nothing could have stay d my father from the breast of bolingbroke o when the king did throw his warder down his own life hung upon the staff he threw then threw he down himself and all their lives that by indictment and by dint of sword have since miscarried under bolingbroke westmoreland you speak lord mowbray now you know not what the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentleman who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled but if your father had been victor there he ne er had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and bless d and graced indeed more than the king but this is mere digression from my purpose here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them everything set off that might so much as think you enemies mowbray but he hath forc d us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love westmoreland mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our hearts should be as good say you not then our offer is compell d mowbray well by my will we shall admit no parley westmoreland that argues but the shame of your offence a rotten case abides no handling hastings hath the prince john a full commission in very ample virtue of his father to hear and absolutely to determine of what conditions we shall stand upon westmoreland that is intended in the general s name i muse you make so slight a question archbishop then take my lord of westmoreland

substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace westmoreland this will i show the general please you lords in sight of both our battles we may meet and either end in peace which god so frame or to the place of difference call the swords which must decide it archbishop my lord we will do so exit westmoreland mowbray there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand hastings fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains mowbray yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and false derived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnow d with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition archbishop no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no tell tale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved
