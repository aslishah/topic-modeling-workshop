elder soldier not a better did i say better brutus if you did i care not cassius when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me brutus peace peace you durst not so have tempted him cassius i durst not brutus no cassius what durst not tempt him brutus for your life you durst not cassius do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for brutus you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am arm d so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answer d caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces cassius i denied you not brutus you did cassius i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friend s infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are brutus i do not till you practise them on me cassius you love me not brutus i do not like your faults cassius a friendly eye could never see such faults brutus a flatterer s would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus cassius come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is a weary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother check d like a bondman all his faults observed set in a note book learn d and conn d by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou be st a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius brutus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humour o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again cassius hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill temper d vexeth him brutus when i spoke that i was ill temper d too cassius do you confess so much give me your hand brutus and my heart too cassius o brutus brutus what s the matter cassius have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humor which my
