between you and i if i might but see you at my death notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter portia o love dispatch all business and be gone bassanio since i have your good leave to go away i will make haste but till i come again no bed shall e er be guilty of my stay nor rest be interposer twixt us twain exeunt scene venice a street enter shylock salarino antonio and gaoler shylock gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy this is the fool that lent out money gratis gaoler look to him antonio hear me yet good shylock shylock i ll have my bond speak not against my bond i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond thou call dst me dog before thou hadst a cause but since i am a dog beware my fangs the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond to come abroad with him at his request antonio i pray thee hear me speak shylock i ll have my bond i will not hear thee speak i ll have my bond and therefore speak no more i ll not be made a soft and dull eyed fool to shake the head relent and sigh and yield to christian intercessors follow not i ll have no speaking i will have my bond exit salarino it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men antonio let him alone i ll follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliver d from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me salarino i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold antonio the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied twill much impeach the justice of the state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh to morrow to my bloody creditor well gaoler on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not exeunt scene belmont a room in portia s house enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and balthasar lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord but if you knew to whom you show this honour how true a gentleman you send relief how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you portia i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord s return for mine own part i have toward heaven breath d a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord s return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you lorenzo madam with all my heart i shall obey you in an fair commands portia my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself so fare you well till we shall meet again lorenzo fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you jessica i wish your ladyship all heart s content portia i thank you for your wish and am well pleas d to wish it back on you fare you well jessica exeunt jessica and lorenzo now balthasar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all th endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin s hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagin d speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee balthasar madam i go with all convenient speed exit portia come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we ll see our husbands before they think of us nerissa shall they see us portia they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack i ll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutred like young men i ll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal
