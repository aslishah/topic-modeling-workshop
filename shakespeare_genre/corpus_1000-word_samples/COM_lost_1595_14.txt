black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the school of night and beauty s crest becomes the heavens well berowne devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady s brows be deck d it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow dumaine to look like her are chimney sweepers black longaville and since her time are colliers counted bright king and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack dumaine dark needs no candles now for dark is light berowne your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be wash d away king twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain i ll find a fairer face not wash d to day berowne i ll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here king no devil will fright thee then so much as she dumaine i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear longaville look here s thy love showing his shoe my foot and her face see berowne o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread dumaine o vile then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walk d over head king but what of this are we not all in love berowne nothing

did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you you have vow d to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study s excellence without the beauty of a woman s face from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and long during action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a woman s face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman s eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty s tutors have enrich d you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady s eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power

drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temper d with love s sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom s sake a word that all men love or for love s sake a word that loves all men or for men s sake the authors of these women or women s sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity
