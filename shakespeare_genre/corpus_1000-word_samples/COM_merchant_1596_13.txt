with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward search d have livers white as milk and these assume but valour s excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchas d by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threaten st than dost promise aught thy plainness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence portia aside how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embrac d despair and shuddering fear and green ey d jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit bassanio what find i here opening the leaden casket fair portia s counterfeit what demi god hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are sever d lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh t entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnish d yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance here s the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleas d with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn to where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave kissing her i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in people s eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirm d sign d ratified by you portia you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlesson d girl unschool d unpractis d happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord s i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you bassanio madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy express d and not express d but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanio s dead nerissa my lord and lady it is now our time that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady gratiano my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too bassanio with all my heart so thou canst get a wife gratiano i thank your lordship you have got me one my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you
