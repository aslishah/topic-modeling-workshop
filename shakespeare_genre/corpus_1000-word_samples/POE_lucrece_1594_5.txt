pride march d on to make his stand on her bare breast the heart of all her land whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale left their round turrets destitute and pale they mustering to the quiet cabinet where their dear governess and lady lies do tell her she is dreadfully beset and fright her with confusion of their cries she much amazed breaks ope her lock d up eyes who peeping forth this tumult to behold are by his flaming torch dimm d and controll d imagine her as one in dead of night from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking what terror tis but she in worser taking from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view the sight which makes supposed terror true wrapp d and confounded in a thousand fears like to a new kill d bird she trembling lies she dares not look yet winking there appears quick shifting antics ugly in her eyes such shadows are the weak brain s forgeries who angry that the eyes fly from their lights in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights his hand that yet remains upon her breast rude ram to batter such an ivory wall may feel her heart poor citizen distress d wounding itself to death rise up and fall beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal this moves in him more rage and lesser pity to make the breach and enter this sweet city first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin to sound a parley to his heartless foe who o er the white sheet peers her whiter chin the reason of this rash alarm to know which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show but she with vehement prayers urgeth still under what colour he commits this ill thus he replies the colour in thy face that even for anger makes the lily pale and the red rose blush at her own disgrace shall plead for me and tell my loving tale under that colour am i come to scale thy never conquer d fort the fault is thine for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night where thou with patience must my will abide my will that marks thee for my earth s delight which i to conquer sought with all my might but as reproof and reason beat it dead by thy bright beauty was it newly bred i see what crosses my attempt will bring i know what thorns the growing rose defends i think the honey guarded with a sting all this beforehand counsel comprehends but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty i have debated even in my soul what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed but nothing can affection s course control or stop the headlong fury of his speed i know repentant tears ensue the deed reproach disdain and deadly enmity yet strike i to embrace mine infamy this said he shakes aloft his roman blade which like a falcon towering in the skies coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies so under his insulting falchion lies harmless lucretia marking what he tells with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon s bells lucrece quoth he this night i must enjoy thee if thou deny then force must work my way for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee that done some worthless slave of thine i ll slay to kill thine honour with thy life s decay and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him so thy surviving husband shall remain the scornful mark of every open eye thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain thy issue blurr d with nameless bastardy and thou the author of their obloquy shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes and sung by children in succeeding times but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend the fault unknown is as a thought unacted a little harm done to a great good end for lawful policy remains enacted the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted in a pure compound being so applied his venom in effect is purified then for thy husband and thy children s sake tender my suit bequeath not to their lot the shame that from them no device can take the blemish that will never be forgot worse than a slavish wipe or birth hour s blot for marks descried in men s nativity are nature s faults not their own infamy here with a cockatrice s dead killing eye he rouseth up himself and makes a pause while she the picture of pure piety like a white hind under the gripe s sharp claws pleads in a wilderness where are no laws to the rough beast that knows no gentle right nor aught obeys but his foul appetite but when a black faced cloud the world doth threat in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding from earth s dark womb some gentle gust doth get which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding hindering their present fall by this dividing so his unhallow d haste her words delays and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays yet foul night working cat he doth but dally while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth no penetrable entrance to her plaining tears harden lust though marble wear with raining her pity pleading eyes are sadly fixed in the remorseless
