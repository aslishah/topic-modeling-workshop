spoke at a venture look here comes more news enter morton northumberland yea this man s brow like to a title leaf foretells the nature of a tragic volume so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood hath left a witness d usurpation say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury morton i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord where hateful death put on his ugliest mask to fright our party northumberland how doth my son and brother thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dread in look so woe begone drew priam s curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percy s death ere thou report st it this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus your brother thus so fought the noble douglas stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds but in the end to stop my ear indeed thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ending with brother son and all are dead morton douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son northumberland why he is dead see what a ready tongue suspicion hath he that but fears the thing he would not know hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes that what he fear d is chanced yet speak morton tell thou an earl his divination lies and i will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong morton you are too great to be by me gainsaid your spirit is too true your fears too certain northumberland yet for all this say not that percy s dead i see a strange confession in thine eye thou shakest thy head and hold st it fear or sin to speak a truth if he be slain say so the tongue offends not that reports his death and he doth sin that doth belie the dead not he which says the dead is not alive yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell remember d tolling a departing friend lord bardolph i cannot think my lord your son is dead morton i am sorry i should force you to believe that which i would to god i had not seen but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down the never daunted percy to the earth from whence with life he never more sprung up in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp being bruited once took fire and heat away from the best temper d courage in his troops for from his metal was his party steel d which once in him abated all the rest turn d on themselves like dull and heavy lead and as the thing that s heavy in itself upon enforcement flies with greatest speed so did our men heavy in hotspur s loss lend to this weight such lightness with their fear that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim than did our soldiers aiming at their safety fly from the field then was that noble worcester too soon ta en prisoner and that furious scot the bloody douglas whose well labouring sword had three times slain the appearance of the king gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame of those that turn d their backs and in his flight stumbling in fear was took the sum of all is that the king hath won and hath sent out a speedy power to encounter you my lord under the conduct of young lancaster and westmoreland this is the news at full northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn in poison there is physic and these news having been well that would have made me sick being sick have in some measure made me well and as the wretch whose fever weaken d joints like strengthless hinges buckle under life impatient of his fit breaks like a fire out of his keeper s arms even so my limbs weaken d with grief being now enraged with grief are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif thou art a guard too wanton for the head which princes flesh d with conquest aim to hit now bind my brows with iron and approach the ragged st hour that time and spite dare bring to frown upon the enraged northumberland let heaven kiss earth now let not nature s hand keep the wild flood confined let order die and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the first born cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead travers this strained passion doth you wrong my lord lord bardolph sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour morton the lives of all your loving complices lean on your health the which if you give o er to stormy passion must perforce decay you cast the event of war my noble lord and summ d the account of chance before you said let us make head it was your presurmise that in the dole of blows your son might drop you knew he walk d o er perils on an edge more likely to fall in than to get o er you were advised his flesh was capable of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit would lift
