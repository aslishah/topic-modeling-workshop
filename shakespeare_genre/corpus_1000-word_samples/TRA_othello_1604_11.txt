this are we turn d turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that look st dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee iago i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and

there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determin d sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return d the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till to night i ne er might say before when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of
