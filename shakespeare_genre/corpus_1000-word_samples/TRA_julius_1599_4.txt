in the theatre i am no true man brutus what said he when he came unto himself casca marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he pluck d me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but there s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabb d their mothers they would have done no less brutus and after that he came thus sad away casca ay cassius did cicero say any thing casca ay he spoke greek cassius to what effect casca nay an i tell you that i ll ne er look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesar s images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if could remember it cassius will you sup with me tonight casca casca no i am promised forth cassius will you dine with me tomorrow casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating cassius good i will expect you casca do so farewell both exit casca brutus what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school cassius so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite brutus and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you cassius i will do so till then think of the world exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar s ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure exit scene iii the same a street thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero cicero good even casca brought you caesar home why are you breathless and why stare you so casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil
