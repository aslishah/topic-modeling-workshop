i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants i pray you fail me not bottom we will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously take pains be perfect adieu quince at the duke s oak we meet bottom enough hold or cut bow strings exeunt act ii scene i a wood near athens enter a fairy at one door and puck at another puck how now spirit whither wander you fairy over hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier over park over pale thorough flood thorough fire i do wander everywhere swifter than the moon s sphere and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green the cowslips tall her pensioners be in their gold coats spots you see those be rubies fairy favours in those freckles live their savours i must go seek some dew drops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip s ear farewell thou lob of spirits i ll be gone our queen and all her elves come here anon puck the king doth keep his revels here to night take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stol n from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call d robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he puck thou speak st aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there but room fairy here comes oberon fairy and here my mistress would that he were gone enter oberon at one door with his train and titania at another with hers oberon ill met by moonlight proud titania titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company oberon tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord titania then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stol n away from fairy land and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steep of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskin d mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity oberon how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravish d and make him with fair aegle break his faith with ariadne and antiopa titania these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summer s spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by paved fountain or by rushy brook or on the beached margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturb d our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suck d up from the

and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon the governess of

and on old hyem s thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the maz d world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original oberon do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but
