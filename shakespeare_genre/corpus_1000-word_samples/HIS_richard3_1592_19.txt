saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr d but nothing spoke in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurl d up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even
