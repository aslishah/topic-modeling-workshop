this fool gudgeon this opinion come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile i ll end my exhortation after dinner lorenzo well we will leave you then till dinner time i must be one of these same dumb wise men for gratiano never lets me speak gratiano well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue antonio fare you well i ll grow a talker for this gear gratiano thanks i faith for silence is only commendable in a neat s tongue dried and a maid not vendible exeunt gratiano and lorenzo antonio is that anything now bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search antonio well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you to day promis d to tell me of bassanio tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridg d from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gag d to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe antonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assur d my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlock d to your occasions bassanio in my school days when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the self same flight the self same way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first antonio you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak bassanio in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalu d to cato s daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strond and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate antonio thou know st that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rack d even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake exeunt scene belmont a room in portia s house enter portia and nerissa portia by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer portia good sentences and well pronounced nerissa they would be better if well followed portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men s cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o er the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curb d by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none nerissa your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lott ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
