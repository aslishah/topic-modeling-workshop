out thy light and lend it not to darken her whose light excelleth thine and die unhallow d thoughts before you blot with your uncleanness that which is divine offer pure incense to so pure a shrine let fair humanity abhor the deed that spots and stains love s modest snow white weed o shame to knighthood and to shining arms o foul dishonour to my household s grave o impious act including all foul harms a martial man to be soft fancy s slave true valour still a true respect should have then my digression is so vile so base that it will live engraven in my face yea though i die the scandal will survive and be an eye sore in my golden coat some loathsome dash the herald will contrive to cipher me how fondly i did dote that my posterity shamed with the note shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin to wish that i their father had not been what win i if i gain the thing i seek a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week or sells eternity to get a toy for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy or what fond beggar but to touch the crown would with the sceptre straight be strucken down if collatinus dream of my intent will he not wake and in a desperate rage post hither this vile purpose to prevent this siege that hath engirt his marriage this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage this dying virtue this surviving shame whose crime will bear an ever during blame o what excuse can my invention make when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly but coward like with trembling terror die had collatinus kill d my son or sire or lain in ambush to betray my life or were he not my dear friend this desire might have excuse to work upon his wife as in revenge or quittal of such strife but as he is my kinsman my dear friend the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end shameful it is ay if the fact be known hateful it is there is no hate in loving i ll beg her love but she is not her own the worst is but denial and reproving my will is strong past reason s weak removing who fears a sentence or an old man s saw shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe thus graceless holds he disputation tween frozen conscience and hot burning will and with good thoughts makes dispensation urging the worser sense for vantage still which in a moment doth confound and kill all pure effects and doth so far proceed that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed quoth he she took me kindly by the hand and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes fearing some hard news from the warlike band where her beloved collatinus lies o how her fear did make her colour rise first red as roses that on lawn we lay then white as lawn the roses took away and how her hand in my hand being lock d forced it to tremble with her loyal fear which struck her sad and then it faster rock d until her husband s welfare she did hear whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer that had narcissus seen her as she stood self love had never drown d him in the flood why hunt i then for colour or excuses all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth affection is my captain and he leadeth and when his gaudy banner is display d the coward fights and will not be dismay d then childish fear avaunt debating die respect and reason wait on wrinkled age my heart shall never countermand mine eye sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage my part is youth and beats these from the stage desire my pilot is beauty my prize then who fears sinking where such treasure lies as corn o ergrown by weeds so heedful fear is almost choked by unresisted lust away he steals with open listening ear full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust both which as servitors to the unjust so cross him with their opposite persuasion that now he vows a league and now invasion within his thought her heavenly image sits and in the self same seat sits collatine that eye which locks on her confounds his wits that eye which him beholds as more divine unto a view so false will not incline but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart which once corrupted takes the worser part and therein heartens up his servile powers who flatter d by their leader s jocund show stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours and as their captain so their pride doth grow paying more slavish tribute than they owe by reprobate desire thus madly led the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed the locks between her chamber and his will each one by him enforced retires his ward but as they open they all rate his ill which drives the creeping thief to some regard the threshold grates the door to have him heard night wandering weasels shriek to see him there they fright him yet he still pursues his fear as each unwilling portal yields him way through little vents and crannies of the place the wind wars with his torch to make him stay and blows the smoke of it into his face extinguishing his conduct
