dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mock ry take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an ent red tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o er run and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th hand and with his arms out stretch d as he would fly grasps in the corner the welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise new born gawds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o er dusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction achilles of this my privacy i have strong reasons ulysses but gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam s daughters achilles ha known ulysses is that a wonder the providence that s in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus gold finds bottom in th uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our island sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hector s sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides o er the ice that you should break exit patroclus to this effect achilles have i mov d you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loath d than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemn d for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dew drop from the lion s mane be shook to airy air achilles shall ajax fight with hector patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him achilles i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gor d patroclus o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when they sit idly in the sun achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus i ll send the fool to ajax and desire him t invite the troyan lords after the combat to see us here unarm d i have a woman s longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view enter thersites a labour sav d thersites a wonder achilles what thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself achilles how so thersites he must fight singly to morrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing achilles how can that be thersites why a stalks up and down like a peacock a stride and a stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the man s undone for ever for if hector break not his neck i th combat he ll break t himself in vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general he s grown a very land fish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkin achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites thersites who i why he ll answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in s arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax achilles
