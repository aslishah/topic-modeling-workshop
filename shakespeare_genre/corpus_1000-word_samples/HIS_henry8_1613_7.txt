to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the king s attorney on the contrary urg d on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desir d to have brought viva voce to his face at which appear d against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devil monk hopkins that made this mischief second gentleman that was he that fed him with his prophecies first gentleman the same all these accus d him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but
