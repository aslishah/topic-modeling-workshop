against the part i come with so i ll die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself i ll dedicate let me make men know more valour in me than my habits show gods put the strength o the leonati in me to shame the guise o the world i will begin the fashion less without and more within exit scene ii field of battle between the british and roman camps enter lucius iachimo and the roman army at one door and the briton army at another leonatus posthumus following like a poor soldier they march over and go out alarums then enter again in skirmish iachimo and posthumus he vanquisheth and disarmeth iachimo and then leaves him iachimo the heaviness and guilt within my bosom takes off my manhood i have belied a lady the princess of this country and the air on t revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl a very drudge of nature s have subdu d me in my profession knighthoods and honours borne as i wear mine are titles but of scorn if that thy gentry britain go before this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds is that we scarce are men and you are gods exit the battle continues the britons fly cymbeline is taken then enter to his rescue belarius guiderius and arviragus belarius stand stand we have the advantage of the ground the lane is guarded nothing routs us but the villainy of our fears guiderius and arviragus stand stand and fight re enter posthumus and seconds the britons they rescue cymbeline and exeunt then re enter lucius iachimo and imogen lucius away boy from the troops and save thyself for friends kill friends and the disorder s such as war were hoodwink d iachimo tis their fresh supplies lucius it is a day turn d strangely or betimes let s reinforce or fly exeunt scene iii another part of the field enter posthumus and a briton lord lord cam st thou from where they made the stand posthumus i did though you it seems come from the fliers lord i did posthumus no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a strait lane the enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaught ring having work more plentiful than tools to do t struck down some mortally some slightly touch d some falling merely through fear that the straight pass was damm d with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with length ned shame lord where was this lane posthumus close by the battle ditch d and wall d with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserv d so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for s country athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cas d or shame made good the passage cried to those that fled our britain s harts die flying not our men to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards stand or we are romans and will give you that like beasts which you shun beastly and may save but to look back in frown stand stand these three three thousand confident in act as many for three performers are the file when all the rest do nothing with this word stand stand accommodated by the place more charming with their own nobleness which could have turn d a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks part shame part spirit renew d that some turn d coward but by example o a sin in war damn d in the first beginners gan to look the way that they did and to grin like lions upon the pikes o the hunters then began a stop i the chaser a retire anon a rout confusion thick forthwith they fly chickens the way which they stoop d eagles slaves the strides they victors made and now our cowards like fragments in hard voyages became the life o the need having found the back door open of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound some slain before some dying some their friends o erborne i the former wave ten chas d by one are now each one the slaughter man of twenty those that would die or ere resist are grown the mortal bugs o the field lord this was strange chance a narrow lane an old man and two boys posthumus nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any will you rhyme upon t and vent it for a mockery here is one two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserv d the britons was the romans bane lord nay be not angry sir posthumus lack to what end who dares not stand his foe i ll be his friend for if he ll do as he is made to do i know he ll quickly fly my friendship too you have put me into rhyme lord farewell you re angry exit posthumus still going this is a lord o noble misery to be i the field and ask what news of me to day how many would have given their honours to have sav d their carcasses took heel to do t and yet died too i in mine own woe charm d could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds
