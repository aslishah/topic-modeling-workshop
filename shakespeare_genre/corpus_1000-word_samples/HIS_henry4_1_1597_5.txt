again of my wife s brother then his cheek look d pale and on my face he turn d an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer wor i cannot blame him was not he proclaim d by richard that dead is the next of blood north he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered wor and for whose death we in the world s wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of hot but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown north he did myself did hear it hot nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wish d him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fool d discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish d honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdain d contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say wor peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quick conceiving discontent i ll read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to o er walk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear hot if we fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare north imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience hot by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this half faced fellowship wor he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while hot i cry you mercy wor those same noble scots that are your prisoners hot i ll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not i ll keep them by this hand wor you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep hot nay i will that s flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i ll holla mortimer nay i ll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion wor hear you cousin a word hot all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i d have him poison d with a pot of ale wor farewell kinsman i will talk to you when you are better temper d to attend north why what a wasp stung and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman s mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own hot why look you i am whipp d and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richard s time what do you call the place a plague upon t it is in gioucestershire twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bow d my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke when you and he came back from ravenspurg north at berkeley castle hot you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me look when his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale for i have done wor nay if you have not to t again we ll stay your leisure hot i have done i faith wor then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted to northumberland you my lord your son in scotland being thus employ
