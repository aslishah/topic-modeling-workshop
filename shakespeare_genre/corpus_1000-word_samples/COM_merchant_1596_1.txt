on the continent act scene i venice a street enter antonio salarino and salanio antonio in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a want wit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself salarino your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings salanio believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad salarino my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea i should not see the sandy hour glass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dock d in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessel s side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanc d would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise antonio believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad salarino why then you are in love antonio fie fie salarino not in love neither then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad now by two headed janus nature hath fram d strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bag piper and other of such vinegar aspect that they ll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano salanio here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well we leave you now with better company salarino i would have stay d till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me antonio your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th occasion to depart salarino good morrow my good lords bassanio good signiors both when shall we laugh say when you grow exceeding strange must it be so salarino we ll make our leisures to attend on yours exeunt salarino and salanio lorenzo my lord bassanio since you have found antonio we two will leave you but at dinner time i pray you have in mind where we must meet bassanio i will not fail you gratiano you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously chang d antonio i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one gratiano let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio i love thee and tis my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dress d in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools i ll tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for
