to warwick yet am i arm d against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edward s cause king edward now brother richard will you stand by us gloster ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign pow r exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french and other forces warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence comes enter clarence and somerset speak suddenly my lords are we all friends clarence fear not that my lord warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn d an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward s brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in night s coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp d his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well cover d with the night s black mantle at unawares may beat down edward s guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then let s on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt scene iii edward s camp near warwick enter certain watchmen to guard the king s tent watchman come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep watchman what will he not to bed watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress d watchman to morrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent watchman t is the lord hastings the king s chiefest friend watchman o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field watchman t is the more honour because more dangerous watchman ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands t is to be doubted he would waken him watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage
