of flowers be not with mortal accidents opprest no care of yours it is you know tis ours whom best i love i cross to make my gift the more delay d delighted be content your low laid son our godhead will uplift his comforts thrive his trials well are spent our jovial star reign d at his birth and in our temple was he married rise and fade he shall be lord of lady imogen and happier much by his affliction made this tablet lay upon his breast wherein our pleasure his full fortune doth confine and so away no farther with your din express impatience lest you stir up mine mount eagle to my palace crystalline ascends sicilius he came in thunder his celestial breath was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle stoop d as to foot us his ascension is more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak as when his god is pleas d all thanks jupiter sicilius the marble pavement closes he is enter d his radiant roof away and to be blest let us with care perform his great behest the ghosts vanish posthumus waking sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but o scorn gone they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake poor wretches that depend on greatness favour dream as i have done wake and find nothing but alas i swerve many dream not to find neither deserve and yet are steep d in favours so am i that have this golden chance and know not why what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare one be not as is our fangled world a garment nobler than that it covers let thy effects so follow to be most unlike our courtiers as good as promise reads whenas a lion s whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp d branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not either both or nothing or senseless speaking or a speaking such as sense cannot untie be what it is the action of my life is like it which i ll keep if but for sympathy re enter gaoler gaoler come sir are you ready for death posthumus over roasted rather ready long ago gaoler hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are well cook d posthumus so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot gaoler a heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth you come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness o of this contradiction you shall now be quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and creditor but it of what s past is and to come the discharge your neck sir is pen book and counters so the acquittance follows posthumus i am merrier to die than thou art to live gaoler indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall go posthumus yes indeed do i fellow gaoler your death has eyes in s head then i have not seen him so pictur d you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or to take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journey s end i think you ll never return to tell one posthumus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness i am sure hanging s the way of winking enter a messenger messenger knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king posthumus thou bring st good news i am call d to be made free gaoler i ll be hang d then posthumus thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead exeunt all but the gaoler gaoler unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets i never saw one so prone yet on my conscience there are verier knaves desire to live for all he be a roman and there be some of them too that die against their wills so should i if i were one i would we were all of one mind and one mind good o there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses i speak
