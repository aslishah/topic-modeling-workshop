highness pleased to forget my place the majesty and power of law and justice the image of the king whom i presented and struck me in my very seat of judgement whereon as an offender to your father i gave bold way to my authority and did commit you if the deed were ill be you contented wearing now the garland to have a son set your decrees at nought to pluck down justice from your awful bench to trip the course of law and blunt the sword that guards the peace and safety of your person nay more to spurn at your most royal image and mock your workings in a second body question your royal thoughts make the case yours be now the father and propose a son hear your own dignity so much profaned see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted behold yourself so by a son disdain d and then imagine me taking your part and in your power soft silencing your son after this cold considerance sentence me and as you are a king speak in your state what i have done that misbecame my place my person or my liege s sovereignty king you are right justice and you weigh this well therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honours may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did so shall i live to speak my father s words happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand the unstained sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done gainst me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your well practised wise directions and princes all believe me i beseech you my father is gone wild into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections and with his spirit sadly i survive to mock the expectation of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion who hath writ me down after my seeming the tide of blood in me hath proudly flow d in vanity till now now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the best govern d nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you
