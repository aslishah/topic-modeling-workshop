purchase friends and give to courtesans still revelling like lords till all be gone whileas the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shar d and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargain d for and sold methinks

cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england s soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that s the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose church like humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and england s dear bought queen and humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars then will i raise aloft the milk white rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum d and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce i ll make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pull d fair england down
