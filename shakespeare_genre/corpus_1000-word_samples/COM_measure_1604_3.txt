new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his eminence that fills it up i stagger in but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscour d armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him claudio i have done so but he s not to be found i pr ythee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as moves men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack i ll to her claudio i thank you good friend lucio lucio within two hours claudio come officer away exeunt scene iv a monastery enter duke and friar thomas duke no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour

statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds which for this fourteen years we have let sleep even like an o ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threat ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children s sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock d than fear d so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum friar it rested in your grace to unloose this tied up justice when you pleas d and it in you more dreadful would have seem d than in lord angelo duke i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo impos d the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i pr ythee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar moe reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a
