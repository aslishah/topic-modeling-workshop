this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sigh d his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night jessica in such a night did thisby fearfully o ertrip the dew and saw the lion s shadow ere himself and ran dismay d away lorenzo in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage jessica in such a night medea gather d the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson lorenzo in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont jessica in such a night did young lorenzo swear he lov d her well stealing her soul with many vows of faith and ne er a true one lorenzo in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her jessica i would out night you did no body come but hark i hear the footing of a man enter

yet no matter why should we go in my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air exit stephano how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold there s not the smallest orb which thou behold st but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the young eyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it enter musicians come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music music jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music lorenzo the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turn d to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not mov d with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music enter portia and nerissa at a distance portia that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle portia so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nerissa it is your music madam of the house portia nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day nerissa silence bestows that virtue on it madam portia the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season season d are to their right praise and true perfection peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awak d music ceases lorenzo that is the voice or i am much deceiv d of portia portia he knows me as the blind man knows
