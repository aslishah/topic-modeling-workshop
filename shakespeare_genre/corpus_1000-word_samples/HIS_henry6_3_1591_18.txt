they ll take no offence at our abuse king edward suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick s and must have my will gloster and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward yea brother richard are you offended too gloster not i no god forbid that i should wish them sever d whom god hath join d together ay and t were pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england s queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona gloster and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage king edward what if both lewis and warwick be appeas d by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have join d with france in such alliance would more have strength ned this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage hastings why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safer when t is back d with france hastings t is better using france than trusting france let us be back d with god and with the seas which he hath giv n for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloster and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestow d the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife s son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee clarence in choosing for yourself you show d your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother s will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleas d his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloster aside i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a messenger king edward now messenger what letters or what news from france messenger my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters messenger at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over maskers to revel it with him and his new bride king edward is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage messenger these were her words utt red with mild disdain tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake king edward i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henry s queen for i have heard that she was there in place messenger tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries messenger he more incens d against your majesty than all the rest discharg d me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long king edward ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarn d they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret messenger ay gracious sovereign they are so link d in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick s daughter clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit clarence and somerset follows gloster aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown king edward clarence and somerset both gone
