no none that thou hast wit enough to make gratiano o be thou damn d inexecrable dog and for thy life let justice be accus d thou almost mak st me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit govern d a wolf who hang d for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou lay st in thy unhallow d dam infus d itself in thee for thy desires are wolfish bloody starv d and ravenous shylock till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offend st thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin i stand here for law duke this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he nerissa he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you ll admit him duke of venice with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place meantime the court shall hear bellario s letter clerk your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthazar i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turn d o er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace s request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation duke you hear the learn d bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws give me your hand come you from old bellario portia i did my lord duke you are welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court portia i am informed throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew duke of venice antonio and old shylock both stand forth portia is your name shylock shylock shylock is my name portia of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed to antonio you stand within his danger do you not antonio ay so he says portia do you confess the bond antonio i do portia then must the jew be merciful shylock on what compulsion must i tell me that portia the quality of mercy is not strain d it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god s when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there shylock my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond portia is he not able to discharge the money bassanio yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will portia it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be shylock a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel o wise young judge how i do honour thee portia i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock here tis most reverend doctor here it is portia shylock there s thrice thy money offer d thee shylock an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul no not for venice portia why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant s heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond shylock when it is paid according to the tenour it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a well deserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond antonio
