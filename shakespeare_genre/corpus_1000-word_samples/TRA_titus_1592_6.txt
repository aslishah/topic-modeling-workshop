solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villainy single you thither

acquaint with all what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes height advance you both the emperor s court is like the

vehor exeunt scene ii a forest near rome a lodge seen at a distance horns and cry of hounds heard enter titus andronicus with hunters c marcus lucius quintus and martius titus the hunt is up the morn is bright and gay the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter s peal that all the court may echo with the noise sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor s person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspir

snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind and make a chequer d shadow on the ground under their sweet shade aaron let us sit and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds replying shrilly to the well tun d horns as if a double hunt were heard at once let us sit down and mark their yelping noise and after conflict such as was suppos d the wandering prince and dido once enjoy d when with a happy storm they were surpris d and curtain d with a counsel keeping cave we may each wreathed in the other s
