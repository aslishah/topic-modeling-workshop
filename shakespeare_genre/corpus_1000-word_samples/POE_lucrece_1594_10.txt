never come to growth he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute that thou art doting father of his fruit nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought nor laugh with his companions at thy state but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought basely with gold but stol n from forth thy gate for me i am the mistress of my fate and with my trespass never will dispense till life to death acquit my forced offence i will not poison thee with my attaint nor fold my fault in cleanly coin d excuses my sable ground of sin i will not paint to hide the truth of this false night s abuses my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices as from a mountain spring that feeds a dale shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale by this lamenting philomel had ended the well tuned warble of her nightly sorrow and solemn night with slow sad gait descended to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see and therefore still in night would cloister d be revealing day through every cranny spies and seems to point her out where she sits weeping to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes why pry st thou through my window leave thy peeping mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping brand not my forehead with thy piercing light for day hath nought to do what s done by night thus cavils she with every thing she sees true grief is fond and testy as a child who wayward once his mood with nought agrees old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild continuance tames the one the other wild like an unpractised swimmer plunging still with too much labour drowns for want of skill so she deep drenched in a sea of care holds disputation with each thing she views and to herself all sorrow doth compare no object but her passion s strength renews and as one shifts another straight ensues sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words sometime tis mad and too much talk affords the little birds that tune their morning s joy make her moans mad with their sweet melody for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy sad souls are slain in merry company grief best is pleased with grief s society true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed when with like semblance it is sympathized tis double death to drown in ken of shore he ten times pines that pines beholding food to see the salve doth make the wound ache more great grief grieves most at that would do it good deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood who being stopp d the bounding banks o erflows grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows you mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb within your hollow swelling feather d breasts and in my hearing be you mute and dumb my restless discord loves no stops nor rests a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears come philomel that sing st of ravishment make thy sad grove in my dishevell d hair as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment so i at each sad strain will strain a tear and with deep groans the diapason bear for burden wise i ll hum on tarquin still while thou on tereus descant st better skill and whiles against a thorn thou bear st thy part to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i to imitate thee well against my heart will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye who if it wink shall thereon fall and die these means as frets upon an instrument shall tune our heart strings to true languishment and for poor bird thou sing st not in the day as shaming any eye should thee behold some dark deep desert seated room the way that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold will we find out and there we will unfold to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze wildly determining which way to fly or one encompass d with a winding maze that cannot tread the way out readily so with herself is she in mutiny to live or die which of the twain were better when life is shamed and death reproach s debtor to kill myself quoth she alack what were it but with my body my poor soul s pollution they that lose half with greater patience bear it than they whose whole is swallow d in confusion that mother tries a merciless conclusion who having two sweet babes when death takes one will slay the other and be nurse to none my body or my soul which was the dearer when the one pure the other made divine whose love of either to myself was nearer when both were kept for heaven and collatine ay me the bark peel d from the lofty pine his leaves will wither and his sap decay so must my soul her bark being peel d away her house is sack d her quiet interrupted her mansion batter d by the enemy her sacred temple spotted spoil d corrupted grossly engirt with daring infamy then let it not be call d impiety if in this blemish d fort i make some hole through which i may convey this troubled soul yet die i will not till my collatine have heard the cause of my untimely death that he may vow in that sad hour of mine revenge on him that made me stop my breath my stained blood to tarquin i ll bequeath which by him tainted shall for him
